in this appeal,voice of the arab world,voaw challenges the district court interlocutory order granting mdtv medical news now,medical news now motion to preliminarily enjoin voaw from the use,sale,or promotion of the mark mdtv,or formative versions of that mark on the internet,in connection with informational or educational programming or services.because we find that the district court abused its discretion in presuming that medical news now was likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief,we vacate the district court preliminary injunction order and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
facts and procedural history 
voaw is a massachusetts corporation whose alleged mission is to provide objective,current and accurate healthcare information to patients and physicians via radio,television,satellite broadcast and the internet.it claims to supply information to citizens of arab and muslim countries about healthcare options available in the united states.
medical news now,on the other hand,describes itself as a medical news organization and producer of the nationally broadcasted television series mdtv medical news now,which the parties do not dispute has aired continuously since.
first use of the mdtv mark in commerce 
the parties agree that medical news now began using the mdtv mark in commerce in january and has made continuous use thereof.however,medical news now disputes voaw assertion that the latter has made continuous use of the mdtv mark in commerce since.
voaw alleges that it first made use of the mdtv mark in the production of television programs from through the mid.furthermore,it contends that in it began to make use of the mark in connection with its internet website and has made continuous use ever since.medical news now,however,challenges these assertions and maintains that they are contradicted by the record.first,medical news now notes that,although voaw federal registration of the mdtv mark indicates that voaw first used the mark in commerce in,a sworn declaration signed by voaw president,zagloul ayad,on december,in connection with voaw application for state registration of the mdtv mark in massachusetts establishes that voaw first use of the mdtv mark anywhere was on march.second,medical news now argues that voaw claim that it has been using the mdtv mark on the internet since is belied by voaw own assertion that it registered the mdtv internet domain names between november,and february,third,medical news now contends that the evidence in the record regarding voaw use of the mdtv mark prior to which consists primarily of certain and a declaration by ayad is limited and unconvincing.the district court agreed with medical news now and found that evidence of any commercialization by voaw prior to is either dubious,or worse.voice of the arab world,mdtv med.news now,gao,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
registration of the mdtv mark 
on october,medical news now filed applications with the united states patent and trademark office uspto to register the marks mdtv and mdtv medical news now,both in connection with certain commercial cable television broadcast and entertainment services.the uspto issued registrations in favor of medical news now for the mdtv and mdtv medical news now marks on december,and april,respectively.both registrations state that the marks were first used in commerce in january.
on september,voaw filed an application with the uspto to register the mdtv mark in connection with providing the arab and muslim world with periodicals,information and educational services in the field of medicine via radio,television,satellite broadcast and the internet.the uspto initially refused voaw application,stating that medical news now prior registration stood as a barrier.however,the uspto later approved voaw application and issued a registration in its favor on september,it is unclear what the reasoning was behind the uspto initial rejection and later approval of voaw application to register the mdtv mark.nevertheless,the district court found that medical news now earlier registration has priority.
history of delay in seeking injunctive relief 
on january,medical news now,through its counsel,sent voaw a letter threatening to bring a trademark infringement action against voaw unless certain questions regarding the use of the mdtv mark were answered.the letter strongly urged voaw to select an alternative mark for its services so as to avoid even the possibility of confusion and gave voaw fifteen days to respond.after receiving the letter,voaw did not cease to use the mdtv mark and medical news now took no legal action.rather,as previously mentioned,later that year on september,voaw applied for federal registration of the mdtv mark.
in september,medical news now offered to pay voaw per month for a banner advertisement or landing page on voaw website at that would direct internet users to medical news now own website at.the parties,however,were unable to reach an agreement at that time.
subsequently,in august,medical news now,through its counsel,offered to enter into an agreement with voaw whereby voaw would have been required to,among other things,withdraw its pending federal application for the mdtv mark,allow medical news now pending federal application to mature into registration and not challenge medical news now rights to the mark,and use its trade name voice of the arab world on the opening splash page or first page of all promotions or advertisements that used the mdtv mark.in exchange,medical news now offered to,among other things,refrain from challenging voaw continued use under common law of the mdtv mark,and pay voaw a fee of per month to rent use of the domain address www.mdtv.com.the parties,nevertheless,were unable to finalize this proposed agreement.
the parties did,however,later reach a verbal agreement in under which medical news now promised to pay per month to voaw for the latter to host a banner advertisement on its website that would refer interested users to medical news now own website however,medical news now soon lost interest in the banner referral apparently because it produced little or no traffic and in requested that voaw discontinue it.the record shows that the parties relationship soured further during this time.while voaw attempted to collect allegedly due and unpaid banner rental fees,medical news now asserted that voaw misleadingly induced it into renting the banner by providing false information concerning the expected traffic.
on september,medical news now filed a petition in the uspto to cancel voaw registration of the mdtv mark.this proceeding is now pending before the trademark trial and appeal board.
subsequently,in august,voaw made changes to the text appearing on at least one of its static webpages by declaring a wider scope of intended services,providing internet links to certain medical entities,and creating subdomain names.the district court found significant that the revised version of the websites deleted any limiting references to the muslim and arab world.voice of the arab world,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
on august,medical news now sent voaw a letter threatening to file an action for trademark infringement and domain name cybersquatting unless voaw agreed to transfer the mdtv domain names to medical news now in exchange for a nominal sum.thereafter,on september,voaw filed an action in the district court seeking declaratory judgment that it had a right to use and register the mdtv mark,and that its activities did not infringe upon medical news now purported rights in the mdtv mark,or constitute domain name cybersquatting.
medical news now responded on november,by bringing counterclaims against voaw for trademark infringement,unfair competition and cybersquatting.in addition,on november,medical news now moved to preliminarily enjoin voaw from using the mdtv mark.on february,the district court granted medical news now motion and issued an order preliminarily enjoining voaw from the use,sale or promotion of the mdtv mark or formative versions thereof on the internet,in connection with information or educational programming or services.voaw appeals the district court preliminary injunction order

iii.discussion 
voaw challenges the district court preliminary injunction order on three grounds.first,voaw alleges that the district court erred in finding that medical news now demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark infringement claim.second,voaw avers that the district court erred as a matter of law by presuming that medical news now would likely suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief,and not requiring medical news now to actually demonstrate such likelihood of irreparable harm.third,voaw contends that,even if a preliminary injunction was appropriate,the district court nevertheless abused its discretion by issuing an overly broad injunction.
voaw argument on the irreparable harm issue is.first,voaw maintains that presuming irreparable harm in trademark infringement cases where preliminary injunctive relief is sought is inconsistent with the supreme court opinion in ebay mercexchange,d.second,voaw contends in the alternative that,even if irreparable harm may be presumed in certain trademark infringement cases,such presumption can not apply here,in light of medical news now excessive delay in seeking injunctive relief.
as discussed below,we agree that the traditional equitable principles discussed by the supreme court in ebay apply in the present case.see am.med.axiom worldwide,cir concluding that the principles of ebay applied to a request to preliminarily enjoin alleged trademark infringement,but declining to decide whether such principles precluded the district court from presuming irreparable harm.however,it is unnecessary to decide at this time whether the rule relied upon by the district court,irreparable harm is presumed upon a finding of likelihood of success on the merits of a trademark infringement claim is consistent with such principles,because even if we assume without deciding that such rule is good law we still find that the district court abused its discretion in applying such a presumption here.this is due to the fact that such presumption has been held inapplicable in cases where,as here,the plaintiff delays excessively in seeking injunctive relief.
accordingly,we find that the district court erred as a matter of law in presuming irreparable harm and,thus,abused its discretion.we,therefore,vacate the district court preliminary injunction order and remand the case 
we begin our discussion by delineating the applicable preliminary injunction standard.in doing so,because there seems to be confusion in some district courts as to whether the principles of ebay apply to preliminary injunctions of alleged trademark infringement,see,operation able of greater,able network,d,we clarify certain aspects concerning the application of ebay in this context.
preliminary injunction standard 
a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy,munaf geren,d quoting charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed hereinafter wright miller,that is never awarded as of right.id.at.rather,as the supreme court recently reaffirmed,a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.winter natural res.def.council,d.
the supreme court has repeatedly held that the basis for injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been irreparable injury and the inadequacy of legal remedies.weinberger romero barceló,d see also wright miller,at noting that p erhaps the single most important prerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction is a demonstration that if it is not granted the applicant is likely to suffer irreparable harm before a decision on the merits can be rendered.thus,a n injunction should issue only where the intervention of a court of equity is essential in order effectually to protect property rights against injuries otherwise irremediable.romero barceló,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
this circuit has previously held that a trademark plaintiff who demonstrates a likelihood of success on the merits creates a presumption of irreparable harm.am.bd.of psychiatry neurology,johnson powell,cir citing societe des produits nestle,casa helvetia,cir keds renee int l trading,cir camel hair cashmere inst.of,associated dry goods,cir.however,the validity of this rule has been called into question by the supreme court recent opinion in ebay.
in ebay,the supreme court reviewed a request for permanent injunction in a patent infringement case and held that the decision whether to grant or deny injunctive relief rests within the equitable discretion of the district courts,and that such discretion must be exercised consistent with traditional principles of equity,in patent disputes no less than in other cases governed by such standards.at.the supreme court concluded that neither the district court nor court of appeals fairly applied these traditional equitable principles.id.at.
specifically,the supreme court noted that the district court appeared to adopt certain expansive principles suggesting that injunctive relief could not issue in a broad swath of cases.id.for example,the district court concluded that a plaintiff willingness to license its patents and its lack of commercial activity in practicing the patents was sufficient to establish that the plaintiff would suffer no irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court found that traditional equitable principles do not permit such broad classifications and concluded that the district court adoption of a categorical rule can not be squared with the principles of equity adopted by congress.id.
the supreme court also rejected the reasoning of the court of appeals,which had reversed the district court and granted injunctive relief.specifically,the supreme court found that the court of appeals had improperly departed in the opposite direction by establishing a general rule,unique to patent disputes,that a permanent injunction will issue once infringement and validity have been adjudged,except in the unusual case,under exceptional circumstances and in rare instances to protect the public interest.id.at.quoting mercexchange,llc ebay,some internal quotation marks omitted.
although ebay dealt with the patent act,in the context of a request for permanent injunctive relief,we see no principled reason why it should not apply in the present case.see am.med,at.
first,the text and logic of ebay strongly suggest that the traditional principles of equity it discussed should be presumed to apply whenever a court must determine whether to issue an injunction,whether the case is a patent case or any other type of case.in this regard,it is significant that the court in ebay supported its formulation of the traditional permanent injunction standard by citing cases that were unrelated to patent law.specifically,the court cited romero barceló,at,which involved a permanent injunction issued after a finding that the defendant violated the federal water pollution control act,and amoco production gambell,d,which related to a request to preliminarily enjoin an alleged violation of of the alaska national interest lands conservation act.see ebay,at.the court then analyzed whether the traditional equitable principles set forth in these cases applied in the patent law context and answered in the affirmative,noting that a major departure from the long tradition of equity practice should not be lightly implied,id.quoting romero barceló,at,and finding that n othing in the patent act indicate d that congress intended such a departure,id.at.similarly,nothing in the lanham act indicates that congress intended to depart from traditional equitable principles.rather,like the patent act the lanham act provides a court the power to grant injunctions,according to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court may deem reasonable,to prevent,among other things,trademark infringement and domain name cybersquatting.a emphasis added.this provision codifies the traditional equitable remedy of injunction.see anne gilson lalonde,gilson on trademarks the principles of equity mentioned in are those that have been established by equity courts in many types of equity cases for years.
second,the fact that ebay dealt with a permanent injunction does not change our conclusion that its principles are equally applicable in the context of preliminary injunctions.this conclusion is buttressed by the logic and language of ebay,which,as previously mentioned,supported its formulation of the traditional test by citing amoco production,a case that involved a request for a preliminary injunction.see ebay,at.our conclusion is also consistent with supreme court precedent,which has repeatedly recognized that t he standard for a preliminary injunction is essentially the same as for a permanent injunction with the exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits rather than actual success.amoco prod,at,cited with approval in winter.at.
based on the above,we conclude that a request to preliminarily enjoin alleged trademark infringement is subject to traditional equitable principles,as set forth by the supreme court in ebay,and more recently in winter,which also discusses such principles we,however,decline to address at this time the full impact of ebay and winter in this area.for example,we do not address whether our previous rule,relied upon by the district court,that a trademark plaintiff who demonstrates a likelihood of success on the merits creates a presumption of irreparable harm,see johnson powell,at,is consistent with traditional equitable principles.in other words,we decline to decide whether the aforementioned presumption is analogous to the general or categorical rules rejected by the supreme court in ebay see ebay,at.our reasons for deferring this question are.first,the parties briefs were inadequate on this particular issue.second,it is unnecessary to decide this question here because even if we assume without deciding that said presumption is good law we still find that the district court abused its discretion in applying the presumption here,in light of the fact that such presumption has been held inapplicable in cases where the party seeking injunctive relief excessively delays in seeking such relief.
it has been held that any presumption of irreparable harm that may arise upon a finding of likelihood of success on the merits of a trademark infringement claim is inoperative if the plaintiff has delayed either in bringing suit or in moving for preliminary injunctive relief.tough traveler,outbound,cir.the reasoning behind this principle is that the failure to act sooner undercuts the sense of urgency that ordinarily accompanies a motion for preliminary relief and suggests that there is,in fact,no irreparable injury.id.quoting citibank,citytrust,cir.however,it has also been held that the aforementioned presumption may still operate where the delay was caused by the plaintiff ignorance of the defendant competing product or the plaintiff making good faith efforts to investigate the alleged infringement.id.
in the present case,the district court suggested that the fact that medical news now knew of and acquiesced to voaw use of the mdtv mark for almost ten years meant that,prior to august,the date of the alleged changes to voaw websites,medical news now claims of irreparable harm would have been rejected.see voice of the arab world,wl,at,dist.lexis,at noting that medical news now apparently would not disagree with the proposition that its claims of irreparable harm would have been rejected if voaw had not revised its websites in august.however,the district court found that the deletion from voaw websites in august of the limiting reference to a particular geographic or market,the muslim and arab world,changed the calculus,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.thus,although the district court suggested that any presumption of irreparable harm had become inoperative prior to august,the court found that such presumption was later revived as a result of the revisions to voaw websites in august,and was still operative when medical news now sought injunctive relief on november.see,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.we disagree.
medical news now has known of voaw allegedly infringing use of the mdtv mark since at least january,when it sent voaw a letter requesting certain information and strongly suggesting that voaw cease using the mark.in the following years,the parties continuously disputed each other rights over the mark.the parties engaged in negotiations on various occasions,including in august,at which time medical news now offered to,among other things,refrain from challenging voaw continued use under common law of the mdtv mark and,in exchange,requested,among other things,that voaw withdraw its pending application for federal registration of the mark and agree to use its trade name voice of the arab world as a limiting reference on all promotions and advertisements that used such mark.significantly,during various months in and,medical news now paid voaw a fee of per month for the rent of a banner advertisement on voaw website.therefore,medical news now was well aware of voaw use of the mdtv mark and can not claim that the nearly delay between the time that it purportedly first became aware of voaw allegedly infringing trademark uses,january and when it finally sought preliminary injunctive relief,november,was due to good faith investigation efforts.neither can medical news now attribute such delay merely to its attempts at reaching a settlement with voaw,since the record does not show significant negotiations after.accordingly,we find that medical news now business dealings with voaw particularly,the banner rental in and,combined with its delay in seeking injunctive relief,indicate acquiescence.
furthermore,assuming without deciding that the district court was correct in finding that the august revisions to voaw websites at least theoretically increased the likelihood of confusion in the market,see voice of the arab world,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,we find,as further explained below,that medical news now subsequent delay in seeking injunctive relief along with the minimal likelihood of a qualitatively new harm arising from those revisions,precludes medical news now from enjoying the benefit of a presumption of irreparable harm.
first,we note that the revisions to voaw websites occurred in august.on august,medical news now sent voaw a letter noting these changes and threatening to take legal action against voaw unless voaw agreed to transfer the mdtv domain names to medical news now in exchange for a nominal sum.yet,it is significant that medical news now did not seek preliminary injunctive relief until november,and only did so after voaw first sued for declaratory judgment on september.consistent with its delay in resolving the underlying disagreement,medical news now leisurely pace and lack of urgency undercut a presumption of irreparable harm.
second,assuming without deciding that medical news now was at one point entitled to benefit from a presumption of irreparable harm,we disagree with the district court that the august revisions to voaw websites mainly,deleting the limiting reference to the muslim and arab world justify a renewal of such presumption.see bourne tower records,cir interpreting citibank,as holding that acquiescence in an infringement rebuts the presumption of
