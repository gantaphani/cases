we review the facts in the light most favorable to the jury guilty verdict.see united states rodríguez,cir.
the interstate stalking convictions follow upon benjamin lee turbulent relationship with his,tawny lee,who had left him in missouri,and her boyfriend,timothy mann,with whom she lived in maine.because two lees are involved,we use their first names.
tawny met benjamin in colorado around,when she was eight.she began dating mann when she was.after mann left to work on a family farm,he and tawny separated,and tawny began dating benjamin.tawny continued a friendship with mann,angering benjamin,which eventually caused tawny to distance herself from mann.tawny mother and a friend testified that benjamin was controlling and verbally abusive toward tawny.
one incident occurred around.benjamin drove up to a car containing tawny,her brother,her,and mann,whom tawny had previously dated.benjamin approached the car,opened the driver side door,pushed the driver seat forward,pulled tawny out of the car by her clothing,pushed her into his car,and drove away.tawny testified that,while driving away,benjamin told her if he could have tawny,no one could.tawny stayed with benjamin because she feared what he could possibly do or would do.they married in the late,eventually having two children.six months after the car incident,tawny and benjamin argued.tawny ran out of their home to the end of the street,where benjamin grabbed her by the hand and pulled her back into the apartment where they lived.
tawny testified that benjamin subjected her to near daily verbal abuse for the duration of their marriage.according to the presentence investigation report,they divorced in.
tawny returned to benjamin when he told her he had people watching mann house,where tawny spent time.tawny and benjamin moved together from colorado to missouri.in,the couple remarried,so benjamin could have back surgery while covered by tawny insurance.benjamin continued to abuse tawny,verbally and sometimes physically.
on july,tawny picked up medication for benjamin,then picked her son up from college before returning home.on returning home,benjamin berated tawny for failing to drop the medicine off with benjamin first,and when tawny tried to flee,benjamin hit her with his cane.tawny daughter called the police,but tawny did not press charges.
in the fall of,tawny reconnected with mann through facebook.around the same time,she testified that she also became upset at benjamin associat ion with people that tawny felt had extreme poor moral conduct.the couple argued,and tawny repeatedly threatened to leave benjamin.in december,tawny made plans to leave.
in february,benjamin broke his back in an automobile accident.he was hospitalized for two weeks,and tawny cared for him at home for six weeks.
in april,tawny left benjamin and moved with mann to maine.in the ensuing months,benjamin searched for tawny,emailing her times and calling relatives.some of the emails contained threats toward mann and threats to n ail tawny head on the wall.tawny mother filed a police report after benjamin left her angry messages accusing her of hiding tawny.
the lees communicated by phone and email,with benjamin blaming his behavior on his medications.tawny insisted that benjamin leave her alone,but benjamin threatened that he would find her when able and that the police would not be able to prevent him from acting.tawny understood one email from benjamin to be a death threat.
benjamin was hospitalized in missouri three times between april and july.his diagnoses included altered mental status,hypoglycemia,drug abuse,diabetes,a thyroid disorder,high blood pressure,and depression.benjamin,who is morbidly obese,was scheduled to have another back surgery,and the lees began communicating more frequently by phone.tawny took his emails after the hospitalization to be more cordial and not rude.around the same time,at the urging of benjamin sister,tawny gave benjamin her address in maine.she and mann had moved to limerick,maine,and tawny was concerned that benjamin would discover her previous address and entangle the person living there,mann uncle.she also thought that benjamin would eventually discover her location.
upon learning tawny location,benjamin told a friend that he would kill mann and if tawny did come home,he would kill her too.his sister testified that,in july and august,benjamin made promises to harm tawny or mann.on july,benjamin changed his will to leave everything to his son,to the exclusion of his wife and daughter.
in august,benjamin borrowed his brother white cadillac and told his son and a sister that he was leaving for a fishing trip in colorado with a friend.disbelieving him,benjamin sisters contacted tawny and warned her that they thought benjamin was headed to maine.tawny and mann applied for a restraining order in maine state court near sanford,maine,on september,but it was refused.
benjamin was in fact heading to maine.on september,from a mcdonald in rumford,maine,an hour from limerick,benjamin emailed tawny and said,misleadingly,that he was en route to his mother home in kansas.later that day,mann spotted a white cadillac with missouri license plates driving past the house in which tawny and mann lived.the car drove past the house approximately a dozen times,then stopped,and the driver got out of the car,opened the car trunk,then closed it and returned to the driver seat.tawny called the police,while mann got his shotgun.mann testified that everybody was in a state of panic and scared to death.the car moved on.
a maine state trooper stopped the white cadillac about four miles from the home and arrested benjamin.a search of the car revealed five firearms,including two loaded handguns and a loaded shotgun.the car also contained two knives,a bayonet,two rolls of duct tape,rope,rubber gloves,plastic bags and sheeting,handcuffs,camouflage face paint,ammunition,maps identifying tawny home,and a walker.benjamin brother testified that the family kept many of those items in the car for hunting and camping,but also that other of the items found in the car did not belong to him.analysis of benjamin computer showed that he had searched for a blueprint of tawny home,and he told the police that he had been able to find its layout.a camera contained photos of the house.after the arrest,lee son discovered a note from his father explaining that,when the son read it,lee would probably be either dead or not with you any longer.lee did not testify he did present four defense witnesses.
on december,benjamin was charged in the united states district court for the district of maine with two counts of interstate stalking,with tawny and mann each identified as a victim.the federal interstate stalking statute punishes those who 
travel in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent to kill,injure,harass,intimidate,or place under surveillance with intent to kill,injure,harass,or intimidate another person,and in the course of,or as a result of,such travel or presence engage in conduct that 
a places that person in reasonable fear of the death of,or serious bodily injury to 
i that person 
ii an immediate family member of that person or 
iii a spouse or intimate partner of that person or 
b causes,attempts to cause,or would be reasonably expected to cause substantial emotional distress to a person described in clause i,ii,or iii of subparagraph a 
on september,a jury convicted benjamin on both counts.
the presentence investigation report recommended a guidelines sentencing range of to months.the district court varied above the guidelines,imposing a total sentence of months months on count one and months on count two,to be served consecutively,followed by three years of supervised release.the district court entered the judgment on january,and this appeal followed the same day.
benjamin challenges both his conviction and sentence.
conviction 
benjamin attacks his trial in three respects.first,he argues that the district court erred in admitting evidence of his history of abusing tawny.second,he argues that the district court improperly truncated his trial proceedings,preventing him from obtaining a fair trial.third,he argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him.he is wrong on all three.
evidentiary rulings 
before trial,benjamin moved in limine to exclude evidence of the car incident,the incident involving the cane,and any evidence of a pattern of his abuse of tawny during their marriage,under rules b and of the federal rules of evidence rule b prevents the introduction of prior bad acts to prove a person character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character,though it permits the introduction of the same evidence to show motive or intent,or for other purposes.b.as relevant here,rule allows a court to exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.id.
the district court denied the motion as to testimony regarding the prior abuse of tawny.in its view,evidence of benjamin past abuse of tawny was relevant to whether her fear of benjamin at the time of his arrest was reasonable,and that reasonable fear went to an element of the offense.see a defining the crime as conduct that places that person in reasonable fear of serious harm emphasis added.the evidence was also relevant to benjamin motive or intent,a permissible purpose under rule b.see.b.to minimize prejudice,the district court gave a limiting instruction,explaining that the evidence of past physical or verbal abuse could not be used to infer guilt for the charged crime through benjamin character,but only for the limited purpose of deciding whether benjamin,at the time of his interstate travel,had the state of mind or intent necessary to commit the crimes charged.this instruction limited use of the testimony at trial to a basis more narrow than it concluded when denying the motion in limine.
we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion.united states tse,cir.there was none.benjamin principal argument on appeal is that the evidence of a defendant past abuse of a victim is irrelevant.he relies on the interstate stalking statute language that a violator must place a person in reasonable fear by conduct in the course of,or as a result of,interstate travel or presence.under his reading,only conduct that occurs during interstate travel or after arrival is relevant to the offense,and that makes any earlier conduct irrelevant.
this court rejected this argument in united states walker,cir.there,we affirmed the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal which had been based on the same grounds as benjamin now argues.see id.at.we held that conduct causing reasonable fear as a result of interstate travel must be viewed in the historical perspective of previous events.id.at.having so read the statute,we also rejected the defendant challenge to the introduction of his threats and violent behavior prior to his interstate travel,explaining that it was relevant to the reasonableness of apprehension of harm.id.at.the analysis in walker applies here.benjamin prior bad acts are relevant to the reasonableness of the fears of tawny and mann,which are informed by the context in which benjamin engaged in interstate travel.
benjamin argues that even if the evidence were relevant,its relevance is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.see.we overturn a district court rule balancing o nly rarely and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances.united states mehanna,cir quoting united states.pires,cir internal quotation marks omitted.there is no extraordinarily compelling reason to do so here,especially in light of the district court limiting instruction.
trial timing 
benjamin trial was scheduled to conclude on monday,september.well before trial,a pretrial schedule was set,without objection,which so provided.the presiding judge had planned to travel outside maine the following day.during the trial,the judge ensured that the trial proceeded efficiently,telling the parties to keep using every available minute and warning the jury that they might need to stay late on monday.the defendant counsel expressed some concern about the schedule on thursday,september.but on friday,september,the parties rested,and the defense told the judge,we are in very good shape.no further witnesses.the jury deliberated on the and returned a verdict the same day.
on appeal,benjamin argues that the district court unreasonably and arbitrarily insisted that the case be finished by monday,september,depriving him of a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.our review is for abuse of discretion,reversing only where the court exhibited an unreasonable and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.united states romero lopez,cir quoting united states mangual santiago,cir internal quotation marks omitted.at the close of his case,defense counsel expressed satisfaction with the proceedings.on appeal,benjamin does not identify any evidence he was prevented from offering or any prejudice to him.see united states delgado marrero,cir emphasizing the importance of prejudice when reviewing the denial of a continuance.the district court did not abuse its discretion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
benjamin attacks the sufficiency of the evidence in a variety of respects.tawny and mann fears were unreasonable,he argues,in light of his health problems,his lack of alarming conduct while driving by the house,and his arrest several miles from their home.the items found in his car are used in camping,and some belonged to his brother.he never directly threatened mann,and his threats to tawny were hyperbolic reactions to the demise of his marriage.he says tawny had to have known that his threats were caused by mental problems associated with his health,and once he recovered from hypoglycemia,their communications were nonthreatening and focused on property issues relating to their divorce.and,the pro se brief adds,he traveled to maine only to take photos for use in the divorce,so he lacked the criminal intent required by statute.that,of course,is not what he said earlier,when he said that he was going to kill mann,and if tawny did come home,he would kill her too.
we affirm if a rational jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.walker,at.it is abundantly clear from the record that a rational jury could find the defendant guilty.
sentencing 
benjamin similarly attacks his month sentence in three respects.we review challenges to a sentence in two steps,reviewing claims of procedural error before considering the sentence substantive reasonableness.united states flores machicote,cir.our review is for abuse of discretion,evaluating the interpretation and application of the guidelines de novo and factual findings for clear error.united states maisonet gonzález,wl,at cir.may.
first,benjamin argues that the district court improperly applied a sentencing enhancement for offenses involving a pattern of activity involving stalking,threatening,harassing,or assaulting the same victim when calculating his guidelines range.b.the commentary to the guidelines indicates that a pattern of activity involves,under the totality of the circumstances,any conduct that occurred prior to or during the offense however,conduct that occurred prior to the offense must be substantially and directly connected to the offense.id.cmt.we have analyzed this provision by identify ing a pattern of activity that fits the guideline description,and determin ing whether the offense involves that pattern.united states robinson,cir.
the district court found that benjamin threatened tawny in a series of emails through the spring of.that is enough
