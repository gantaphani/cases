nicole lang once worked for wal mart stores east.while there,she claimed a disability arising from her pregnancy status,though she insisted that she could perform the essential functions of her job with a reasonable accommodation.seeing things differently,wal mart refused her accommodation request.and then,later on,wal mart terminated her.
lang eventually sued,claiming violations of the federal americans with disabilities act popularly known as the ada and the new hampshire civil rights act.after discovery,the district judge granted wal mart summary judgment on all claims.the judge ruling failed to convince lang.but for reasons we explain later,we think that summary judgment is called for which leads us to affirm.
how the case got here 
taking all disputed facts in the light most sympathetic to lang as the party opposing summary judgment,see soto padró pub.bldgs,cir,we believe the competent evidence tells the following tale.
sometime in july,lang became an unloader at wal mart distribution center in raymond,new hampshire.an unloader as the name implies unloads merchandise hauled to the center in tractor trailers.wal mart form says that the essential functions of an unloader include unloading freight from trailer manually or with power equipment.but the form also adds that m ov ing,lift ing,carry ing,and plac ing merchandise and supplies weighing up to pounds without assistance are physical activities necessary to perform one or more essential functions of this position.asked at her deposition whether wal mart expected her to be able to lift up to pounds by herself,lang said yes.that jibes with this statement by the center distribution manager,who said that unloaders are required to lift merchandise or supplies weighing up to pounds without assistance.
wal mart randomly assigns unloaders to trailers usually one unloader per trailer,about unloaders per shift in a way so that the oldest trailer gets unloaded first some freight typically freight weighing more than pounds furniture,for instance is labeled team lift,meaning the assigned unloader needs to have another unloader and possibly more help out.most freight has no label or marks indicating its weight,however.so unloaders often do not know the freight weight before lifting it,though the record is uncontested on the point that the great majority of freight weighs more than pounds.
unloaders occasionally use forklifts and other power equipment to unload some trailers like when the trailers have merchandise stacked on pallets.we say occasionally use and some trailers for several reasons.one is that cargo frequently shifts in transit,breaking the pallets and forcing unloaders to remove items by hand.a second is that if an unloader spills cargo while using power equipment,she would then have to pick up the spilled cargo by hand.a third is that many vendors try to pack as much merchandise into the trailers as humanly possible,the result being that many trailers including what the parties call rbd trailers have cargo stacked from floor to ceiling.and unloaders must unload these trailers by hand,a process,to be sure.all and all,according to the unrebutted affidavit of the operations manager at this wal mart center,about of the trailers require some degree of manual labor to unload them.
in late september about two months after becoming an unloader lang learned that she was pregnant.her doctor told her on october not to lift anything over pounds.convinced that her bosses at wal mart would have a problem with a pound restriction,lang asked the doctor if we could just hold off on the note.the doctor said okay but added,do lift anything over pounds.
a week or two later still in october lang told her manager,brian hug,about the pregnancy and the lifting restriction.hug was excited to hear about the pregnancy excited is the word lang used in her deposition.hug asked her if she had a doctor note,to which she answered no.lang did not ask wal mart to accommodate her condition at that time.instead she kept on doing her regular unloader duties,including lifting though she later recalled getting more rbd trailers than usual to unload,and she sometimes had to ask other unloaders to help her.
on november,lang pulled a muscle lifting a heavy,unmarked box.as for which muscle,she said in her interrogatory answers that she had pulled a groin muscle later at a deposition she said that she had pulled a muscle in her uterus and still later in court papers she said again that she had pulled a groin muscle.anyway,lang told hug about the pull that day,november.hug brought her to the center office.and someone from wal mart department bridget ronaghan drove lang home,though ronaghan made a point of telling her that her pregnancy was a liability and that she should ask for leave under the federal family medical leave act fmla.lang doctor told her to take some excedrin,soak in a tub,and ice the injured area.
lang felt fine her word the next day.but wal mart told her to take the day off.that same day,november,lang husband also a wal mart employee asked the manager,andrea rose,if lang could get reassigned to a post sweeper,cleaner,or if she could just unload trailers with a forklift.rose refused,saying if i had to accommodate her,i have to accommodate the rest.
after talking with a lawyer at the new hampshire commission for human rights nhchr,for short,lang formally asked wal mart for an accommodation near the end of november.on the form,she listed pregnancy as her condition or impairment.and the medical questionnaire filled out by her doctor said that she could not lift more than pounds.as for an accommodation,lang asked wal mart to either assign her to trailers that do need to be unloaded by hand,or to give her a job that does deal with lifting over pounds.but wal mart said no,concluding that her pregnancy is considered temporary and so not eligible for an accommodation.wal mart also added that the lifting restrictions imposed by her doctor prevent her from performing the essential functions of her job.lang did two things in response first,she asked for permission from wal mart to take fmla leave of absence through june.and even though she would exhaust her fmla leave rights by the end of december,wal mart approved the full leave amount.second,while on leave,she filed a charge of discrimination with the nhchr,alleging as relevant here that wal mart had discriminated against her because of her pregnancy status and had failed to reasonably accommodate her medical disability.rose knew about lang nhchr complaint,lang tells us,though she does not tell us what the nhchr did with her discrimination charge.
lang gave birth to a son on june.after taking a maternity leave,she returned to work as an fid processor wal mart had given her unloader position to someone else.her new job required her to a use a forklift to bring pallets of cargo to designated areas b scan and label the cargo boxes and c then put the boxes on a conveyor belt.supervisors kept eyeing her as she did her fid processor duties,however,like she was doing something wrong conduct that made her feel uncomfortable.adding to her belief that wal mart was targeting her,some there a saw her talking to an associate at work and told her not to speak with other workers b occasionally had her repeat tasks,an area she had already dusted though she conceded that sometimes the request made sense,like the time someone from corporate was coming to visit and her bosses wanted everything to look clean and c took days to finally approve her request for extra time so that she could use her breast pump during breaks.
in,lang hurt her arm while putting a box on the conveyor belt.she told a supervisor about what had happened.and the supervisor asked whether she was joking.another wal mart manager brought her to the hospital,where a doctor diagnosed her with a pinched ulnar nerve,gave her a brace,and told her to ice her arm and take ibuprofen.consistent with its workers compensation procedure,wal mart gave lang a temporary alternative duty assignment involving dusting,which would allow her to work while she recovered if she could not return to her regular job after days,wal mart would place her on workers compensation.
about a month later,in december,lang still had arm pain.so manager rose without consulting lang placed her in another temporary alternative duty position,this one involving label sorting.according to lang deposition,rose felt like if she extended my light duty that i keep my income.
lang and her husband had long wanted to move to florida.and rose had known about the couple wish to move there since at least november.in february,lang husband asked for and received a transfer to a wal mart distribution center in the sunshine state.wal mart,though,apparently had a policy prohibiting persons on temporary alternative duty assignments from transferring meaning rose unilateral decision extending lang assignment effectively blocked lang ability to transfer to florida with her husband.lang then got permission to take an unpaid leave from work to receive medical care for her arm injury.and with that leave in place,the langs moved to florida at the end of february.
around this time lang received notice that her claim for workers compensation was in all capital letters hereby denied by employer or insurance carrier.no causal relationship to employment was the reason listed,though the notice added that extent of disability was questionable.denise kondor name appears on the form,on the line provided for authorized representative.and national union fire insurance company is listed as the insurance carrier.lang affidavit stated that kondor worked as a claims adjuster for a company called sedgwick and that sedgwick had denied my workers compensation request.lang,however,points us to nothing in the record explaining whether she ever contested the denial of her workers comp claim.
jumping to april,we see that rose,relying on corporate policy,asked lang to submit medical documentation to support the leave.but lang had trouble finding a florida physician willing to treat her and sign the wal mart required forms,because the carrier would not acknowledge liability for her medical bills.so wal mart extended her leave to august,to give her more time to locate a doctor.rose,though,had no sympathy for lang,telling her that she lang had put herself in this position.after lang failed to submit the necessary forms by the august deadline,wal mart terminated her,with rose processing the termination as a voluntary quit which,rose later confirmed,made lang eligible for by wal mart.
disappointed,lang sued wal mart in new hampshire federal court.pertinently,she alleged that wal mart had failed to accommodate her disability arising from her pregnancy status,in violation of the ada.she also alleged that wal mart had discriminated against her because of her disability and had retaliated against her because of her accommodation request and her nhchr complaint,all in violation of new hampshire law.
following discovery during which lang filed an affidavit saying in part that t he only essential functions of the unloader position that she could not perform had to do with weight asked the judge for summary judgment on all claims.lang opposed,conceding that wal mart job description for unloader requires an employee to have the ability to move,lift,carry and place merchandise and supplies of up to a maximum of pounds without assistance,but insisting that wal mart should have reasonably accommodated her by placing her in another suitable position.
hoping to nail lang argument down,the judge said during argument on the motion that moving,lifting,etc,up to pounds without assistance is an undisputed description of the job essential function s.so,the judge added,turning to lang lawyer,y ou saying make some accommodation which would enable lang to perform this pound weight limit,but what you essentially saying is she ca lift anything more than pounds.lang lawyer responded,c orrect.t hat takes it into a totally different type of job,the judge pointed out.perhaps,lang attorney said,though she faulted wal mart for not engaging in an interactive process to come up with an accommodation.and lang lawyer stressed a little later that the job description is not in dispute.
the judge later issued a thorough opinion jettisoning lang ada claim because in the judge view the record did not establish that a lang had a disability within the ada meaning that b she could perform the job essential functions,either with or without a reasonable accommodation i t is undisputed,the judge wrote,that lifting items weighing up to pounds was an essential function of her job and that she submitted paperwork from her doctor indicating that she could not lift items weighing more than pounds or that c her requested accommodations were reasonable.and since lang had not put enough in the record to show either that she had been disabled under the ada or that she could perform essential job functions,the judge knocked out the discrimination claim too.wrapping up,the judge concluded that the materials did not establish either that there was a causal connection between her protected conduct her request and nhchr complaint and wal mart adverse action terminating her or that wal mart rationale for her termination was pretextual which led the judge toss out her retaliation claim as well.
lang later asked the judge to reconsider the ruling.once again conceding as the judge had found that lifting pounds was an essential function of her job as an unloader,lang claimed that the judge had botched matters in two ways first,by relying on caselaw predating critical amendments to the ada disability definition,and,second,by overlooking that wal mart had never devised a suitable accommodation through an interactive process with her.but the judge stuck to her guns,ruling that the ada amendments did not affect her conclusion and that wal mart had no obligation to engage in an interactive process because lang did not have an ada disability.lang then appealed to us.
summary judgment standard 
we give de novo review to the judge grant of summary judgment,drawing all reasonable inferences in lang favor and affirming if no genuine dispute as to any material fact exists and wal mart merits judgment as a matter of law.see.a see also collazo rosado of,cir.because our review is de novo,we can affirm on any ground appearing in the record including one that the judge did not rely on.see,collazo rosado,at.
the ada forbids a covered employer which all agree wal mart is from discriminating against a qualified individual,see u.a,relevantly defined as a person who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of her job,see id.failing to reasonably accommodate a disabled person is a form of disability discrimination,of course.see,faiola apco graphics,cir.and as the judge correctly noted to survive an adverse summary judgment on a claim,a plaintiff must point to sufficient evidence showing that a she is disabled within the ada definition that b she could perform the job essential functions either with or without a reasonable accommodation and that c the employer knew of her disability,yet failed to reasonably accommodate it.see,rocafort ibm,cir.
lang and wal mart spar over every prong.but we begin and end with the issue,we assume without deciding that lang had an ada disability,noting that while the employer bears the burden of showing that a job function is essential,see ward.health research,cir,the employee bears the burden of showing that she could perform that function,even if only with some reasonable accommodation for her disability,see jones walgreen,cir.
recall how wal mart form lists unloading freight from trailer manually or with power equipment as an unloader essential job function,and then adds that m ov ing,lift ing,carry ing,and plac ing merchandise and supplies weighing up to pounds without assistance are physical activities necessary to perform one or more essential functions of this position.without evincing any sense of irony,lang blasts the judge for concluding that manually lifting up to pounds is an essential job function for an unloader as she now sees things,an unloader essential function is not manually lifting items weighing up to pounds but getting cargo off trailers,a task one can do by hand or with power equipment.
we see irony because as we have taken pains to emphasize lang lawyer told the district judge and opposing counsel not once,not twice,but three times in the opposition,during argument on the motion,and in the motion for reconsideration that no one disputes that lifting up to pounds without assistance is repeat,is an essential job function statements,remember,that came after lang had answered yes to a deposition question about whether wal mart expected her to lift up to pounds on her own.representations like the ones made by lang lawyer an officer of the court are solemn undertaking s,binding on the client.genereux raytheon,cir quoting ccm cable,ocean coast,cir.and once made,neither the lawyer nor her clients can complain when the trial court takes them at their word.id.at.the bottom line,then,is that team lang can not forsake its earlier concessions,switching horses midstream to offer an entirely new take on the issue a take that is completely inconsistent with her earlier position.see id.
citing national association of social workers harwood,lang notes that we can choose to consider an argument not raised below the choice is totally up to us,meaning she has no entitlement to that bonanza,and only in extraordinary circumstances few and far between will we relax the rule.see,cir deciding a new issue that was among other things of constitutional importance,threatened a miscarriage of justice if not considered,and lent itself to satisfactory decision on the existing record without any need for further fact development.nothing about our situation screams extraordinary what with lang lawyer having conceded below at every turn that lifting up to pounds without help is an essential job function.and that means that lang case plainly falls within the general rule,not within the exception to it.see id.
shifting gears,lang claims that a jury,given all the evidence,could fairly conclude that she could have performed essential unloader functions had wal mart reasonably accommodated her either by a assigning her only to trailers that did not require unloading by hand or by b transferring her to a vacant position that did not require her to lift up to pounds.and she criticizes the judge for ruling otherwise.but we think the judge got it right.
as we just discussed,lifting up to pounds manually is on this record and at this stage an essential function for unloaders.so lang first proposed accommodation excusing her from manual lifting is a,and for a simple reason.what she really wanted was for wal mart to excuse her from having to perform an essential function.but under the ada,an employer is not required to accommodate an employee by exempting her from having to discharge an essential job function.see,richardson friendly ice cream,cir see also mulloy acushnet,cir explaining that a proposed accommodation that redefin ed an employee job description is per se unreasonable.
as for her other suggested accommodation reassigning her to a vacant position that did not require her to lift up to pounds lang offered no evidence that there were any vacancies when she asked for an accommodation,and it was her burden to show as much.see phelps optima health,cir noting that a r easonable accommodation may include reassignment to a vacant position,and stressing that the employee bears the burden of proof in showing that such a vacant position exists internal quotations and citations omitted.lang begs to differ on whether she met her burden,pointing out two things.
for openers,she notes that her affidavit named three women whom wal mart transferred to less positions after they had become pregnant.wal mart protests that this is all hearsay evidence and one can not fend off summary judgment with inadmissible hearsay,wal mart reminds us.see,dávila corporación de para la difusión pública,cir stressing that i t is law that hearsay evidence can not be considered on summary judgment.but even putting the hearsay question aside,we agree with the judge that the affidavit is not enough to stave off summary judgment.that is because lang affidavit did not mention the specific circumstances of the transfers the document said nothing about the essential functions of the jobs in question,the timing of the trio transfers,the availability or not of a similar job when lang made her accommodation request.and absent information of this sort,the affidavit could not help create a fact issue about whether to quote lang brief a transfer would have been feasible for her.
next,lang plays up how wal mart placed her in a less position the fid processor position when she returned from maternity leave.but that is not enough for her to get to a jury on this issue,because she presented no evidence that wal mart had an open fid processor job or any other job when she made an accommodation request,eight months earlier and employers like wal mart are not obliged to create a job opening so a disabled employee can work.see phelps,at.
in a last ditch effort to save her ada claim,lang argues that we must reverse the grant of summary judgment,because wal mart did not engage in an interactive process.sure,an employee accommodation request can sometimes trigger a duty on the employer part to talk with the employee,with the goal of finding a way to reasonably accommodate her disability.see,eeoc kohl dep t stores,cir.but here is the problem for lang the omission of an interactive process is of no moment if the record forecloses a finding that the employee could do the essential duties of the job,with or without reasonable accommodation,see kvorjak maine,cir which,for reasons already given,is the case here.thus lang argument comes up short.
the net result of all this is that because lang failed to create a trialworthy issue as to whether she could have performed an essential function of her job manually lifting up to pounds with or without a reasonable accommodation,the judge rightly granted summary judgment to wal mart on the ada claim.
so on to the claims we go.
state law claims 
reader alert 
as we mentioned a few pages ago,lang also brought claims of unlawful disability discrimination and retaliation against wal mart,see.ann.a discrimination,a retaliation claims that the judge likewise booted out on summary judgment.lang asks us to reverse.but before weighing in,we must make a short detour to make a couple of observations.
the parties who fight like mad on most issues actually do agree on a few things.like the judge,they assume that because lang essentially seeks to craft her discrimination and retaliation claims from indirect evidence,a federal court must analyze these claims using the regime devised by our supreme court in mcdonnell douglas green,d more on this regime later.like the judge,they also assume that new hampshire and federal courts apply mcdonnell douglas the same way.and like the judge,they assume that the elements for discrimination and retaliation claims are the same under state and federal law more about these elements in a bit.anyhow,these are all issues,involving a dizzying array of statutes with the federal and state statutes not always matching up word for word and caselaw and we wonder whether state and federal law perfectly align on every issue.still,following the judge and the parties lead,we too will assume without holding that new hampshire law is as they say it is.
with these words of caution,we trudge on.
burden shifting explained 
under the mcdonnell douglas regime,lang must first establish the elements for both discrimination and retaliation we will say what those elements are shortly.see in re seacoast fire equip.if she does,wal mart must offer a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the action.see id.and if wal mart satisfies its burden,lang must then show that the reason is pretextual,see id.though a reason can not be proved to be pretextual unless it is shown both that the reason was false,and that a prohibited criterion was the real reason,see mary honor ctr.hicks,d on this last point,we see that 
t he factfinder disbelief of the reasons put forward by the employer particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity may,together with the elements of the prima facie case,suffice to show intentional discrimination.thus,rejection of the employer proffered reasons will permit,though not compel,the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination,and no additional proof of discrimination is required.
in re seacoast fire equip,at quoting mary honor,at all but the first alteration in original.
time to roll up our sleeves and delve into the discrimination and retaliation issues.
discrimination 
proceeding as we said we would on the arguendo assumption that granite state law parallels federal law,we take the elements as argued to us,that lang at step one in the mcdonnell douglas analysis must show that a she was disabled as defined by the ada that b she was qualified to do the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation and that c she suffered an action in whole or in part because of her disability.see jones nationwide life ins,cir.
the simplest way to decide a case is often the best,we have noted,strathmore ins,cir quoting chambers bowersox,cir arnold.and that is true here zeroing in on element b,we easily conclude that lang discrimination claim fails because,as we have already seen,the record does not show that she could perform the essential function of her job manually lifting up to pounds with or without a reasonable accommodation.in other words,what we have said about her ada claim disposes of her discrimination claim at the first step of mcdonnell douglas,the step so we need not run through the rest of the test.
one claim down,one to go.
retaliation 
again indulging the judge and the parties assumption that new hampshire law on retaliation claims like lang mirrors federal law,we take the requirements as presented to us without of course suggesting whether this is or is not an accurate statement of state law,that lang must show that a she engaged in protected activity that b a action by the employer followed and that c a causal link exists between the two.see calero cerezo dep t of justice,cir 
to simplify matters we assume for argument sake that lang established a case,that a her accommodation request and nhchr filing constitute protected activity that b her termination qualifies as an action termination is the action of which she complains and that c a causal link connects these events.and we assume too that wal mart,in turn,offered a legitimate,nonretaliatory reason for the termination,her failure,despite repeated requests,to provide the required medical papers to support her leave she does not really challenge the idea that a failure of that sort could constitute an aboveboard reason for the termination.
so,having assumed without deciding that lang satisfied the first step of mcdonnell douglas establishing a case of retaliation and that wal mart satisfied the second step providing a permissible,nonretaliatory reason for the termination,we are left with the third step and the question of pretext.to reach trial on her retaliation claim,lang must show that wal mart given reason for the termination amounted to a pretext for unlawful retaliation bearing in mind as we said that a reason can not be proved to be a pretext for retaliation unless it is shown both that the reason was false,and that retaliation was the real reason.mary honor,at quoting texas dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d.
in trying to show this,lang does not deny that wal mart stated reason had a basis in fact she concedes or at least does not contest that she never turned over the requested documents,a violation that is a terminable offense and she does not argue that wal mart treated violators of work rules differently,keeping them but not her on the payroll instead she contends that a jury could infer pretext and retaliatory termination in either of two ways or both 
the first way is fairly complicated,involving several parts.bear with us now,please,as we go through them 
part wal mart either denied her workers comp claim on its own or pushed the carrier to deny it.
part wal mart extended lang assignment,forcing her to take an unpaid leave so that she could transfer to florida with her husband wal mart,she reminds us,had a policy of not transferring employees on light duty.
part wal mart insisted that she have a florida doctor fill out forms to verify the need for the leave,even though no doctor would treat her injury and sign the required forms,all because the carrier had refused to acknowledge its liability for her medical bills given the claim denial.
part having created a situation that lang could not escape from,wal mart then used her failure to send the forms as a pretext for fir ing an annoying employee who asserted her rights under the ada too often.
for simplicity,we will refer to this as the wal mart contrivance theory.
the second way is more straightforward.as lang sees it,comments by rose and ronaghan discussed again below reveal animus,giving rise to an inference that wal mart came up with a phony explanation for the termination that retaliation was the real reason behind wal mart decision.for convenience,we will refer to this as the theory.
though we give lang points for creativity,her arguments just do not work.
wal mart contrivance theory 
it should go without saying but we say it anyway that a party can not ward off summary judgment with proffers that depend on arrant speculation,optimistic surmise,or farfetched inference.see fragoso lópez,cir quoting kelly united states,cir.yet that is all lang gives us here.
take the denial of her workers comp claim part of her multipart theory.lang thesis is that wal mart driven by retaliatory rage nixed that claim on its own or in concert with the carrier.for evidence of this theory,she points to one of her answers to interrogatories,which states that rose spoke one on one with lang doctor and with the claims adjuster.surely,she argues,these chats show that something sinister was afoot during the workers comp process which as she tells it suggests that a wal mart had it in for her ever since her accommodation request and nhchr filing and that b wal mart pounced on her failure to file the required forms to mask its illegal motive for getting rid of her.
the stumbling block for lang is that she highlights no evidence on what the participants talked about during those one on one s she,for instance,directs us to no discovery,a deposition of rose that pins down whether what rose said was sinister goading the adjuster or the carrier into denying lang claim or benign giving the adjuster lang basic employment info,like when she started working for wal mart and what her job duties were.what lang hopes to do is to close a chasmal gap between her retaliation theory and proffered facts by floating the sinister possibility.but to escape summary judgment,she must deal in what is probable,not just in what is possible s imply allowing for a possibility our cases say does not make it more likely than not that the possibility happened.see tropigas de,at.at best for lang,her interrogatory answer about the may fuel speculation that wal mart rose might have pushed the carrier to deny the workers comp claim which,again,is one of lang hunches for what might have happened,but that is insufficient to establish a triable issue for the jury,see id.after all,and as we have already pointed out,a litigant like lang who bears the burden of proof on an issue can not defeat summary judgment by relying on speculation about the facts,cahoon shelton,cir see also tobin fed.express,cir emphasizing that s peculation about mere possibilities will not stop summary judgment.so despite lang best guesswork,the denial of her workers comp claim does not allow a jury to make a rational,nonconjectural finding that wal mart given reason for her termination was a pretext for retaliation.see generally curran dep t of justice,cir holding that g uesswork has no place in the calculus.
now consider rose decision to extend lang work part of her multipart theory.that decision suggests illegal animus on wal mart part because rose made that call solely to stop lang from transferring to the everglade state or so the argument goe
