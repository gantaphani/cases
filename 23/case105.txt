aguas lenders recovery group,llc alrg appeals from judge carter dismissal of its complaint on the ground of forum non conveniens.the principal issue is whether,for the purposes of the doctrine of forum non conveniens,a to an agreement may be bound by a forum selection clause and forum non conveniens waiver contained in contracts entered into by an entity alleged to be a predecessor in interest.
we hold that such a may be so bound.we therefore vacate the judgment and remand for limited discovery and a hearing on whether agua y saneamientos argentinos,aysa is a successor in interest to aguas argentinas,aguas.
background 
this is an appeal from a dismissal of a complaint without a factual hearing on the grounds of forum non conveniens.we therefore accept the facts alleged in the complaint as true.see wiwa royal dutch petroleum,cir 
in,the republic of argentina solicited bids from private companies for a concession,which allowed the winning bidder to modernize and operate buenos aires residential water and sewer system and collect fees for its use.until then,a wholly company,obras sanitarias de la nación,had provided the services.
aguas was the winning bidder.it consisted of a consortium of seven companies that included two multinational water companies,suez,and sociedad general de aguas de barcelona,on april,aguas entered into the concession agreement with the argentine government and was thereafter incorporated under the laws of argentina.under the terms of the concession,the argentine government ceded to aquas the right to possess and use certain assets necessary to the operation and maintenance of the water and sewer system,but expressly reserved title to the assets.aguas provided water and sewer services to buenos aires from to.
the concession was expected to require billion in capital investments over its duration,but a substantial portion had to be invested early for modernization and expansion of the systems.aguas secured financing,primarily by recourse to international capital markets,including the united states.on july,following a series of defaults on the loan agreements,aguas restructured a number of these loans in two interim financial agreements ifa.pursuant to these agreements,the lenders bought out some of aguas debt in exchange for payment of interest according to a schedule of installments.the ifa contained a new york forum selection clause and a forum non conveniens waiver collectively forum provisions.they also contained a new york choice of law provision and a provision binding successors and assigns.
in january,aguas defaulted on the interest payments owed under the ifa.subsequently,in july,aquas initiated a contractually established procedure for the termination of the concession.thereafter,on march,the argentine government terminated the concession,alleging that aguas had failed to meet its obligations under the concession,at least in part due to toxic levels of nitrates found in various water sources.the argentine government temporarily assumed operation of the water and sewer facilities pursuant to an executive decree.it soon after assigned the concession to aysa,the appellee here,an entity incorporated on march,for that purpose.
the argentine government currently owns ninety percent of aysa stock while aysa employees,virtually all of whom are former employees of aguas,own the remaining ten percent pursuant to an employee stock ownership program.the assets transferred to aysa included not only the concession itself but physical assets that had been built,improved,or acquired with the money borrowed by aguas.no payment was made to aguas for the transfer of the assets,or to any of its lenders on the outstanding debt.
after the argentine government terminated the concession with aguas,aguas filed for protection from its creditors on april.at the time of the district court decision under review,aguas insolvency proceedings were pending in argentina.
alrg was formed under the laws of new york.it is composed of original and subsequent parties to various loan agreements with aguas between and.alrg constituent members include entities organized under the laws of delaware,germany,the cayman islands,the british virgin islands,and the bahamas.on september,these various lenders assigned to alrg their claims to unpaid amounts under financing agreements with aguas.alrg appears to hold no assets other than the claims based on the loan agreements.
on september,alrg brought the present action against aysa to recover on the defaulted loans and ifa alrg complaint alleged that aysa is not entitled to step into aguas s shoes,yet disclaim aguas s loans and is liable to alrg for the full amount of aguas loans,unpaid interest,and other charges.specifically,alrg alleged that aysa i as successor in interest to aguas,breached the underlying loan agreements,which had been modified by the ifa and ii received a fraudulent transfer of aguas assets to aysa.
on march,the district court dismissed alrg claims against aysa on the ground of forum non conveniens.see aguas lenders recovery group,llc suez,wl.the court reasoned that district courts need not afford great deference to waivers of forum non conveniens upon,even where the is an alleged successor to the waiver.id.at citing yung lee,cir.it concluded that because neither party to the suit was a signatory to the ifa and the defendant did not even exist when the agreements were created,alrg could not invoke the forum provisions.id.absent a binding contractual provision,the district court declined to apply the strict,forum non conveniens analysis dictated by bremen zapata,d,which held that contractual forum selection clauses should be enforced absent a showing of unreasonableness,fraud,or overreaching.instead,applying the traditional forum non conveniens analysis set out by gulf oil gilbert,the district court concluded dismissal was appropriate.see aguas,wl at.alrg then brought this appeal.
discussion 
a district court dismissal of a complaint on the ground of forum non conveniens is reviewed for abuse of discretion.norex petroleum access,cir.a district court abuses its discretion in dismissing on the ground of forum non conveniens when its decision rests either on an error of law or on a clearly erroneous finding of fact,or can not be located within the range of permissible decisions,or fails to consider all the relevant factors or unreasonably balances those factors.pollux holding chase manhattan bank,cir citations omitted.we disagree with the district court conclusion that because aysa was a of the contracts at issue,it was per se not bound by their forum provisions for purposes of applying the doctrine of forum non conveniens.
the enforcement of forum selection clauses in international disputes is governed by bremen zapata,d.bremen noted the important role of forum selection and choice of law clauses in eliminating uncertainty in international commerce and held that such clauses are entitled to a presumption of enforceability,unless enforcement would be unreasonable and unjust,or the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching.bremen,at.thus,where parties contract to a mandatory forum selection clause,in which they agree in advance on a forum that is exclusive of all others,the choice of forum is accorded the bremen presumption of enforceablity.phillips audio active,cir.
in contrast,where parties contract to a permissive forum selection clause,that is,one that designates a forum in advance,but does not preclude a different choice,the bremen presumption of enforceability does not apply.see see also blanco banco industrial de venezuela,cir.instead,in such cases,the traditional forum non conveniens standards articulated by the supreme court in gulf oil gilbert,apply.blanco,at see also iragorri united techs,cir en banc articulating forum non conveniens analysis based on gilbert.
we need not decide whether the forum selection clauses in the present matter are,standing alone,mandatory or permissive.at least one of the of the ifa contains a waiver of any claims of forum non conveniens in addition to a forum selection clause.the combination of these clauses amounts to a mandatory forum selection clause at least where the plaintiff chooses the designated forum,as alrg did here.see aar int l,nimelia enter,cir i n this case we have more than merely a permissive forum selection clause we have such a clause plus unambiguous language providing that the lessee shall not object to venue on the ground of inconvenient forum w e conclude that the stricter standards announced in bremen should control.on the present record,it appears that litigation over that ifa involves issues,witnesses,and documentary evidence that almost fully overlap with the other claims.if that part of the litigation must remain in new york,it would be quite inconsistent with the purposes of forum non conveniens to dismiss the remaining claims under that doctrine.therefore,we see no reason to engage in further inquiry as to the mandatory or nature of the forum selection clauses standing alone.
we thus turn to the issue of whether,even if successorship doctrine binds a to the obligations of a contract,such a is not bound by a mandatory forum selection clause and may freely invoke the doctrine of forum non conveniens.we conclude that,if successorship is established,a is subject to the bremen presumption of the enforceability of mandatory forum selection clauses.
any other conclusion would be inconsistent with the rationales of both successorship doctrine and bremen.successorship doctrine prevents parties to contracts from using evasive,formalistic means lacking economic substance to escape contractual obligations.see united states mexico feed and seed,cir anspec johnson controls,cir.we see no reason to treat forum selection provisions differently from other contractual obligations.as bremen explained,a forum selection clause involving sophisticated parties to an international transaction is an obligation that is calculated by parties into the cost of a contract.see bremen,at.i t would be unrealistic to think that the parties did not conduct their negotiations,including fixing the monetary terms,with the consequences of the forum clause figuring prominently in their calculations.consequently,a forum selection clause is integral to the obligations of the overall contract,and a successor in interest should no more be able to evade it than any other obligation under the agreement.
we find ample support for the conclusion that the fact a party is a to an agreement is insufficient,standing alone,to preclude enforcement of a forum selection clause.see,holland am.line wärtsilä,cir holding that forum selection clauses applied to because larger contract involved transactions that included coastal steel tilghman wheelabrator,cir binding a beneficiary to a forum selection clause,overruled on other grounds by lauro lines chasser,d taag linhas aereas de angola transam.airlines,cir applying bremen to enforce forum selection clause against plaintiff marano enters.of kansas,cir holding were bound by forum selection clause because were closely related to the signatory or had acquiesced to clause by voluntarily bringing suit with signatories lipcon underwriters at lloyd,london,cir holding bound to forum selection clause on grounds that the,who had provided letters of credit to signatories,had interests in the litigation that were directly related to,if not predicated upon those of the signatories citation omitted see also hugel of lloyd,cir in order to bind a to a forum selection clause,the party must be closely related to the dispute such that it becomes foreseeable that it will be bound.citations omitted bonny soc y of lloyd,cir subjecting defendants to forum selection clause because integrally related to contracting defendants such that suit should be kept in a single forum.dayhoff heinz,cir reversing district court dismissal,on ground of forum selection clause,of all of plaintiff claims as to to those agreements,except for one italian corporation who plaintiff alleged was successor to signatory 
the successorship issue must,therefore,be resolved for purposes of applying forum non conveniens.as a threshold matter,the parties dispute whether the question is governed by the law of new york or of argentina.alrg urges that new york law applies but argues that its complaint contains factual allegations sufficient to support a theory of successorship under either new york or argentine law.in response,aysa contends that argentine law applies,but that,in any event,no successorship finding is possible under the law of either argentina or new york.
we intimate no view as to,inter alia,whether new york or argentine law applies or whether the outcome on the merits depends upon the choice of law.for the reasons stated below,we believe that the present record is not sufficient to allow us to dispose of this case without factual findings by the district court,and it would be unwise for us to resolve legal issues that,after factual findings are made,may drop from the case.
under new york law,the general rule is that an asset purchaser is not liable for the seller debts.new york recognizes four exceptions to this rule a buyer who formally assumes a seller debts transactions undertaken to defraud creditors a buyer who de facto merged with a seller and a buyer that is a mere continuation of a seller.cargo partner ag albatrans,cir.thus,for example,when a successor firm acquires substantially all of the predecessor assets and carries on substantially all of the predecessor operations,the successor may be held to have assumed its predecessor liabilities,notwithstanding the traditional rule.nettis levitt,cir,overruled on other grounds by slayton am.express,cir.similarly,alrg has submitted affidavits stating that under argentine law,the transfer of a going concern to another commercial entity that provides the same commercial activities in the same building with identical merchandise directed to the same clients may subject that entity to the liabilities of the predecessor.
alrg argues that it has alleged a prima facie claim that aysa was a successor in interest to aguas.specifically,alrg claims that aguas revenues were directly linked to aguas development of infrastructure and the expansion of the existing municipal water and sewer system in buenos aires,that the loans on which alrg now seeks to recover were made to aguas for this purpose,that infrastructure improvements were made for which aguas was entitled to compensation under the terms of the concession,and that the argentine government terminated the concession,aguas principal asset,and assumed control of aguas under the name of aysa,in which it maintained a ninety percent ownership interest.in so doing,alrg alleges that aysa assumed operating control of the facilities and infrastructure improvements,as well as business channels,to deliver,without interruption,the same services to buenos aires as aguas.alrg finds further support for its theory in an alleged continuity of both employees and management,of ten percent equity ownership through an employee stock ownership program,of assets,including customer lists and accounts receivable,and of contracts.finally,alrg notes that the agreements at issue expressly bind aguas successors and assigns.
under both new york and what little we know of argentine law,the successor issue is highly and,given the present record,can not be resolved with assurance in favor of one party or the other.alrg complaint does allege facts that,if proven,might support a successorship finding.the district court conclusion that a per se could not be bound by the forum provisions obviated the need to resolve the various issues of law and fact relevant to the successorship question.because these issues are better left to resolution by the district court in the first instance,we remand for discovery and a hearing to ascertain,for the purposes of the claim of forum non conveniens,whether argentine or new york law applies and whether aguas is a successor in interest to aysa bound to the ifa and loan agreements.in light of our disposition of this appeal,we do not reach the parties additional arguments regarding whether alrg claims are nonetheless barred under the foreign sovereign immunities act and the doctrine.
