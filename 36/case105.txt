appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york charles brieant,dismissing their claims for substantive violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,rico conspiracy,and violation of the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa,id,for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted,and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their related state law claims.because we agree with the district court that the facts alleged do not establish the continuity required to prove a pattern of racketeering activity,and because the plaintiffs do not challenge the district court dismissal of their cfaa claims,we affirm.
background 
we are reviewing a motion to dismiss and therefore accept the facts alleged in the amended complaint as true.gicc capital tech.fin,cir.
i.the joint venture 
child and family adoption cfa is an authorized adoption agency in new york that was founded and managed by roger spool.in august,cfa entered into a joint venture with the world child international adoption agency world child,an international adoption agency based in maryland and managed by sharrell goolsby.as part of this joint venture,world child located children in foreign countries and processed international dossiers.cfa marketed adoptions in the new york area,helped new clients to complete their international dossiers,and performed various social work services for adoptive parents in new york.
cfa,spool,world child,and goolsby worked together closely for many years to build and expand international adoption services throughout new york.pursuant to their relationship,when clients of the joint venture wanted to adopt a child,they paid two fees directly to world child an agency fee and a foreign program fee.cfa was paid a fixed amount of the agency amount that remained essentially unchanged throughout its relationship with world received no part of the foreign program fee.cfa and world child operated harmoniously under this arrangement for ten years,handling over a thousand international adoptions,including the adoption of a russian child by plaintiffs bruce and charlene ferguson.world child grew into the fourth or fifth largest international adoption agency in the united states.
relations between cfa and world child began to sour in or when world child,although receiving more services from cfa for no additional money,began to demand a greater portion of the fees that the joint venture generated,to refuse to pay invoices,and to contest the legitimacy of cfa charges.in the fall of,world child payments to cfa grew increasingly delinquent.spool and goolsby attempted to settle the dispute over several months,with spool requesting payment of outstanding invoices and goolsby proposing a change to the joint venture payment structure that would reduce cfa payments by almost.during this period,goolsby also proposed that world child hire susan dibble,a longtime cfa employee.
on april,at the conclusion of these unsuccessful efforts at conciliation,carl jenkins,a partner in the jenkins povtak law firm that represented world child,sent spool a letter accusing cfa of terminating the joint venture and revoking cfa authority to act on world child behalf.the day after he received jenkins letter,spool left for a vacation,leaving the management of cfa in the hands of dibble and dorene whitaker,another longtime cfa employee.as it turned out,spool chose an inopportune time to leave.
on april,in the middle of spool vacation,jenkins faxed a letter to cfa confirming a threatened of world child new york operations and offering to transfer business matters,including the costs of telephones,mail handling,and other incidentals,from cfa to world child.according to the amended complaint,another fax had been sent shortly before from cfa office to its telecommunications provider instructing the latter to forward calls placed to cfa number to a different phone number.spool and goolsby names were affixed to this fax,but spool did not authorize the instruction.the next day,jenkins wrote the telecommunications provider on world child letterhead that world child was no longer sharing office space with cfa and requesting that all billing for the number be redirected.dibble wrote to spool,resigning from cfa.
the amended complaint alleges that on april,dibble and whitaker took various client files,agency licenses,office supplies,and marketing materials,including agency letterhead,from cfa office.they used these materials to open their own branch office of world child from dibble residence.world child sent letters to its new york clients announcing that world child new york office was relocating and that the enterprise operated by dibble and whitaker would continue to provide client representation.over the next several weeks,this enterprise engaged in various forgeries with respect to client documents,signing spool name without authorization,improperly notarizing signatures,and falsely affixing cfa agency license on client documents that were submitted to the ins and foreign governments in connection with pending adoptions.dibble and whitaker were eventually arrested for theft and forgery dibble pled guilty in to forgery charges involving several cfa clients.the amended complaint alleges that even after their arrests,dibble and whitaker continued to operate the new york branch office of world child in substantially the same manner until at least april,on which date dibble and goolsby issued some sort of joint communiqué to world child employees and affiliates.
ii.the fergusons adoption 
the fergusons were among the clients swept up in the fracas between cfa and world child.having successfully adopted a child through the joint venture in its happier days,the fergusons began the process of applying to adopt a second child in january.along with world child other clients in the new york area,they received a letter in april informing them that world child new york office had relocated,but failing to indicate that this new office was no longer affiliated with cfa.in may,the fergusons paid world child in foreign program fees in connection with their application to adopt a russian child.
as the fergusons prepared to travel to russia to finalize their adoption,they received instructions from the office now operated by dibble and whitaker to bring large amounts of cash to use as gifts for russian officials.when they arrived in russia in early august,the fergusons were met by defendant yaroslav panasov,world child representative who assisted the fergusons before the local court.the fergusons were required to entertain and feed panasov,and several of the gifts they were instructed to provide went to him and to world child moscow office,even though the fergusons had already paid over in foreign program fees.on august,the russian court denied the fergusons adoption application because it found irregularities in their documentation.panasov filed a handwritten appeal,which was denied on august.the fergusons later learned that several of their documents,including the required update of a home study originally done by cfa in,had been falsified and forged by dibble.
the amended complaint contains additional allegations about world child billing of foreign program fees allegedly based upon information to which spool was privy in his capacity as the head of cfa.in,according to the amended complaint,spool was told by goolsby and jenkins that world child was increasing the foreign program fee that it charged to clients and that it was using the extra payments to cover general expenses while informing clients that the entire fee was necessary to pay foreign affiliates to process adoptions.the plaintiffs allege that world child deposited at least some of these extra fees into the foundation of world child,the foundation,a purportedly entity affiliated with world child that was managed by jenkins and allegedly used to shelter world child assets in order to avoid legal judgments.the amended complaint does not allege that this activity caused damage to spool or cfa,nor that cfa objected to it.
iii.district court proceedings 
the plaintiffs commenced an action in the district court,alleging substantive violations of rico,rico conspiracy,violations of the cfaa,and various state law torts.specifically,the plaintiffs allege the following rico violations.first,they allege that each defendant violated b by maintaining control of alleged rico enterprises consisting of the foundation and dibble and whitaker new york branch office of world child through a pattern of racketeering,the theft of property and the defrauding of the fergusons and other clients.section c was allegedly violated when the defendants,being associated with the new york branch office,engaged in this pattern of racketeering activity.second,they allege that the defendants violated d by conspiring to participate in the illegitimate operation of the new york office,including the fraudulent acts against the fergusons and the theft of cfa property,and the alleged funneling of money from the new york office to the foundation to shield assets from potential creditors.finally,the plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated a by defrauding clients and using the income derived from their frauds to operate the foundation.
the district court dismissed panasov as a defendant on grounds of insufficient process and service of process,dismissed the federal claims against the remaining defendants,and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims.with respect to the rico claims in particular,the district court concluded that the rico allegations are present only as a jurisdictional hook to access the federal courts with what may be valid state law claims for fraud and breach of contract.the court held that the amended complaint did not allege a pattern of racketeering activity.the plaintiffs appeal this determination.
discussion 
we review the district court decision de novo,reading all allegations in the plaintiffs favor.commercial cleaning,colin serv,cir.although we construe the pleadings liberally,bald assertions and conclusions of law will not suffice.leeds meltz,cir.the pleadings must create the possibility of a right to relief that is more than speculative.atsi commc ns,shaar fund,cir.
to establish a rico claim,a plaintiff must show a violation of the rico statute,an injury to business or property and that the injury was caused by the violation of section.defalco bernas,cir quoting pinnacle consultants,leucadia,cir.this case implicates the first of these three requirements,namely,whether the plaintiffs have adequately alleged a violation of the rico statute.
to establish a substantive rico violation,a plaintiff must show a pattern of racketeering activity,a c,and to establish a rico conspiracy,a plaintiff must show a conspiracy to commit a substantive rico violation,id.d.thus,u nder any prong of,a plaintiff in a civil rico suit must establish a pattern of racketeering activity.gicc capital,at.to survive a motion to dismiss,this pattern must be adequately alleged in the complaint.
according to rico definitional section,a pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity,the last of which occurred within ten years after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.the acts of racketeering activity that constitute the pattern must be among the various criminal offenses listed in,and they must be related,and either amount to or pose a threat of continuing criminal activity.cofacrèdit,windsor plumbing supply,cir emphasis omitted quoting nw.bell,d internal quotation marks omitted.the latter continuity requirement can be satisfied either by showing a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of by demonstrating an pattern of racketeering activity that poses a threat of continuing criminal conduct beyond the period during which the predicate acts were performed,at.defalco,at cofacrèdit,at gicc capital,at.we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs here have alleged neither a nor an pattern of racketeering activity.
continuity 
to satisfy continuity,the plaintiff must prove a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.cofacrèdit,at quoting,at.although factors such as the number and variety of predicate acts and the number of participants may be germane to this showing,continuity is primarily a temporal concept.id.the relevant period,moreover,is the time during which rico predicate activity occurred,not the time during which the underlying scheme operated or the underlying dispute took place.defalco,at cofacrèdit,at gicc capital,at because gicc does not allege any racketeering activity in connection with the individual cri defendants takeover of cri,the takeover can not form the starting point of defendants pattern of racketeering activity.
since the supreme court decided,we have never held a period of less than two years to constitute a substantial period of time.cofacrèdit,at.this conception of the substantiality requirement accords with that of other circuits.see gicc capital,at.although we have not viewed two years as a requirement,it will be rare that conduct persisting for a shorter period of time establishes continuity,particularly where,as here and as in gicc capital,t he activities alleged involved only a handful of participants and do not involve a complex,conspiracy.id.quoting polycast tech.uniroyal.
even under the most liberal reading of the amended complaint,the plaintiffs allegations fall short of this benchmark.the amended complaint alleges that some unspecified rico predicates began occurring in january and continued at least through april,when dibble and goolsby issued their joint communiqué upon information and belief,the defendants engaged in the above activities and conduct between january and at least april.first am.compl.this period of time is insufficient to establish in the absence of separate schemes or large numbers of participants and victims.see defalco,at.
neither does this conclusion change if we construe the amended complaint to allege that the defendants began conspiring in late to steal cfa confidential files.the law is clear that the duration of a pattern of racketeering activity is measured by the rico predicate acts that the defendants are alleged to have committed.cofacrèdit,at accord defalco,at.ordinary theft offenses and conspiracies to commit them are not among the predicate activities defined in.such a conspiracy,even if it had been properly pled,therefore can not establish a period of racketeering activity beginning in.even if the plaintiffs had adequately alleged a rico predicate that commenced in late,moreover,the period would still be insufficient.
nor can the defendants alleged overcharging of foreign program fees in late begin the reference period.the amended complaint does not allege these excessive charges to constitute any particular rico predicate.even if we assume that these activities could constitute mail fraud or wire fraud if proved,moreover,the amended complaint is still legally insufficient because the allegations regarding the foreign program fees have not been pled with the requisite particularity.see first capital asset,satinwood,cir a ll allegations of fraudulent predicate acts are subject to the heightened pleading requirements of federal rule of civil procedure b.allegations of predicate mail and wire fraud acts should state the contents of the communications,who was involved,and where and when they took place,and should explain why they were fraudulent.mills polar molecular,cir.here,the only specifically identified individuals who are alleged to have paid foreign program fees are the fergusons,who did so in.the amended complaint,moreover,does not allege any specific fraudulent communications about foreign program fees to them or to anyone else.the sole allegation with regard to fraudulent representations in connection with these fees consists of the allegation that spool was told by jenkins and goolsby in that they were increasing the foreign program fee and using the increase to cover general expenses while informing clients that the extra fee was necessary to pay foreign affiliates.this spare pleading is insufficient to satisfy rule
