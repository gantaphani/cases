background 
petitioner is a citizen of argentina who resides in buenos aires.respondent is a citizen and permanent resident of argentina.the two began dating in and lived in the for a brief period of time before settling in buenos aires in.respondent gave birth to their child,in buenos aires on december.is a citizen of both argentina and the united states.he attended school in buenos aires from through the end of the argentine school year in december.
though petitioner and respondent never married,the family lived together until,when the couple romantic relationship deteriorated and petitioner moved out that summer,the parties reached a child custody agreement which provided that would reside with his mother and granted the father visitation from thursday evenings until sunday nights.per the agreement,respondent could travel outside argentina with for fifteen days in the argentine winter and up to days during the argentine summer the agreement required petitioner to authorize respondent travel with in accordance with that plan.respondent took on multiple trips to the united states in accordance with this plan.
the parties experienced difficulties in their parenting relationship after they ceased cohabiting.in,they argued outside respondent apartment the day she returned from a day trip to the united states with although he was not entitled to visitation that day,petitioner asked to see the child,and respondent told him it was not a good time.petitioner forced his way into her apartment and pushed her to the ground in the process.later that year,the two engaged in a yelling match in presence during a car ride.petitioner called respondent trash and locked her out of the car,driving away with the child.after that argument,respondent denied petitioner visitation for four months.petitioner sought judicial intervention and the argentine family court restored his visitation rights.additionally,the parties filed domestic violence complaints against each other.after an investigation,an argentine board issued a report finding that respondent was the victim of petitioner physical and psychological violence and that was a victim insofar as he witnessed the fight in the car.
in december,the parties negotiated and executed a new coparenting agreement.respondent retained custody and the agreement reduced petitioner visitation.the agreement permitted respondent to travel abroad with the child for up to days each year petitioner would execute authorization each time.
in spring,respondent began to consider leaving argentina to find work elsewhere.she discussed her interest in moving with petitioner,who opposed her leaving argentina with.the district court found that respondent had raised such an interest before and that the parties had various discussions prior to this time about respondent relocating out of the country.the parties were unable to come to an agreement,even after mediation in july.
the next month,respondent accepted a job offer in boston with a september start date.the parties discussed her upcoming move shortly after she accepted the job offer.during an august,skype conversation,respondent urged petitioner to pursue work or educational opportunities in boston.petitioner expressed openness to potentially moving to massachusetts along with respondent and,but the parties reached no agreement during the conversation.
the two met in person three times in august and september to discuss potential arrangements if were to relocate to the united states.during the third meeting,petitioner agreed to allow to move to massachusetts with respondent.respondent proposed that could travel back to argentina during school vacations and agreed to increase petitioner visitation time in anticipation of the move.the same day,the two relayed these plans to 
in accordance with their discussions,respondent left argentina to begin her job in.remained in argentina in the care of respondent mother,and petitioner assumed the increased visitation schedule.the parties corresponded by email after her departure to discuss a new coparenting agreement and to set an exact date for move.petitioner preferred a january move so that the child could complete his school year in argentina respondent wanted him to move before the december holidays so that he could spend time with her family before beginning school in boston.petitioner objected to the december departure,reasoning that respondent family could see any time now that the child was moving to the united states,but confirmed a january,move date.
in their correspondence,respondent expressed frustration that even though the two had agreed that should move to the united states and respondent had relocated to boston with that decision in place,petitioner had yet to draft or sign a new coparenting agreement.after an acrimonious skype exchange on october,respondent emailed petitioner and asserted that she would invoke her days per year vacation time in order to allow to leave for boston in early december.
after that email,the parties communication broke down.petitioner initiated multiple court proceedings,including an emergency petition to obtain temporary custody of and criminal complaints against respondent and her mother.the district court found that petitioner included numerous unfounded statements about respondent in these filings,which stated,among other falsehoods,that she had abandoned and left for the united states without any notice to petitioner.respondent returned to argentina in late november and again in late december to attend court proceedings.at a hearing on petitioner criminal complaints,a criminal court judge reduced petitioner visitation and prohibited him from having overnight visits with 
respondent returned to boston and then came back to argentina on february.the family court judge held a hearing the next day to address petitioner temporary custody proceeding and respondent filing to obtain travel authorization for to visit the for days,pursuant to the parties agreement.the judge ordered the parties to confer and resolve the latter issue shortly after the hearing,they informed the judge that they were unable to agree on a resolution.on february,the judge issued a decision denying respondent request for travel authorization,reasoning that the evidence presented to him indicated an environment of disagreements and hostilities between the parties which would make a trip disfavorable to 
that same day,respondent left argentina with her mother and.the district court found that respondent knew of the argentine family court order denying her travel authorization before she left buenos aires that day.she drove to a border town near brazil and paraguay,and on february,made three trips into brazil and paraguay in search of an airport where could travel to the united states without scrutiny of his visa.on february,respondent and flew out of paraguay to the united states.respondent did not inform petitioner that she had left argentina he discovered that was no longer in the country when the child did not attend his first week of school in march.petitioner found respondent work phone number and repeatedly called her office.she confirmed that was in boston under her care.soon after,respondent obtained an abuse prevention order against petitioner from the suffolk county probate and family court.
petitioner notified the argentine family court judge that respondent had left the country and filed a criminal complaint for child abduction with the argentine police.on april,petitioner filed for hague convention remedies with a central authority in argentina.on july,the argentine family court judge issued an opinion finding that respondent wrongfully removed under the hague convention and that habitual residence at the time of removal was argentina.
and respondent have lived in roslindale,massachusetts since february.attends a boston public school.respondent presented expert testimony and a report to the district court from a child psychologist who interviewed the psychologist wrote in his report that the child spoke adamantly and specifically about not wanting to return to argentina.the expert opined in his report that removal to argentina would sever the bonded relationships with respondent,her fiancé,and her mother and thus expose him to psychological harm.
petitioner filed this action in the district court on october.the court heard three days of evidence in december,and issued its order granting the petition and ordering the child return on january.this expedited appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
a.the hague convention 
the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction is a multilateral agreement among approximately ninety countries,including the united states,intended to combat international child abductions during domestic disputes.abbott.abbott.the convention seeks to enforce custody rights and secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state.chafin chafin,quoting hague convention.the convention underlying principle is that the courts of a child country of habitual residence should be the entities to make custody determinations in the child best interest,lozano montoya alvarez,mauvais herisse,cir.
a petitioner seeking the return of a child under the convention must establish the child wrongful removal by a preponderance of the evidence.e a sánchez londoño gonzalez,cir.the petitioner must show that he or she seeks to return the child to the child country of habitual residence,had custody rights immediately prior to the child removal,and was exercising those rights.hague convention,sánchez londoño,at.if these three elements are met,and the petitioner has commenced judicial or administrative proceedings within one year of the date of wrongful removal,the convention commands that the court reviewing the petition shall order the return of the child forthwith.hague convention.the respondent may counter the presumption of return by establishing the application of one or more of the exceptions or defenses to return enumerated in articles,and of the convention.e chafin.at.notably,an order of return pursuant to the hague convention is not a final determination of custody rights.it simply ensures that custodial decisions will be made by the courts of the children country of habitual residence.neergard colón neergard,cir.
on appeal,respondent disputes that petitioner established his custody rights prior to removal or that argentina was country of habitual residence.she argues that even if petitioner established a presumption of removal,he consented to the child relocation to massachusetts,satisfying the exception to return described in article a of the convention.
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,mindful that any plausible interpretation of the facts can not be rejected just because the record might sustain a conflicting interpretation.darin olivero huffman,cir.interpretations of the convention and the application of the convention to the facts are afforded de novo review.yaman yaman,cir.
habitual residence 
we begin and end with the question of habitual residence at the time of removal.see redmond redmond,f d,cir e very hague convention petition turns on the threshold determination of the child habitual residence all other hague determinations flow from that decision.tsai yi yang fu chiang tsui,cir same.
removal under the hague convention is only appropriate if the child is being retained in a country other than his or her place of habitual residence.sánchez londoño,at.the convention itself does not define habitual residence,leaving the interpretation of the term to the judicial and administrative bodies of signatory nations.see nicolson pappalardo,cir redmond,at mozes mozes,cir.in determining a child habitual residence,this circuit looks first to the shared intent or settled purpose of the persons entitled to determine the child permanent home as a secondary factor,we may consider the child acclimatization to his or her current place of residence sánchez londoño,at.typically,evidence of acclimatization alone can not establish a child habitual residence in the face of shared parental intent to the contrary.neergard colón,at.
the question of habitual residence is a highly inquiry that turns on the particular circumstances of each unique case.in discerning the parties intentions,this court will look specifically to the last moment of the parents shared intent.mauvais,at.where a child has moved with a parent from one country to another,the record must evidence the parties latest settled intention for the child to abandon a former place of habitual residence and acquire a new one.darin,at.in other words,the court must determine from all available evidence whether the parent petitioning for return of a child has already agreed to the child taking up habitual residence where it is.id.citing mozes,at.the district court ultimate determination of habitual residence is a mixed question of law and fact reviewed de novo,with subsidiary findings of the parties intent reviewed for clear error.neergard colón,at.
as the district court found in its opinion,during a meeting at a buenos aires restaurant in early september,petitioner agreed to let move to boston after the close of the child school year in argentina.the same day,the parties together told their son that he would move to massachusetts with respondent.nevertheless,the district court found that petitioner and respondent came close to forming a shared intent,but did not actually do so.
this finding constitutes clear error.the record is replete with petitioner own statements acknowledging and planning for the child upcoming move,particularly during september and october of,after respondent moved to boston and before the parties relations broke down and petitioner initiated civil and criminal proceedings against respondent and her mother.for example,on september,in response to respondent request for to fly to the united states that december,petitioner wrote in an email,i would prefer if you can wait until he moves to you by the end of the year i really do not see the point of him going there when it would be just two or three weeks before he moves there.on october,petitioner suggested that respondent meet him and in miami in january and then take the child back to boston,since petitioner and his family had planned to be in florida for a family trip that month.after respondent suggested that petitioner and meet her in new york to celebrate the new year,petitioner said he would check with his family but stated,for now,what is sure is january the.even during a tense skype exchange on october,petitioner expressed his understanding that would permanently move to the united states at the turn of the new year.respondent renewed her request for to move before january,alluding to her family holiday celebration in new york petitioner responded that will be in the us sic in january sic and that respondent family will have plenty of time to spend with the child know sic that is going to be in the us sic living there.after this skype exchange,respondent emailed petitioner and stated that she would invoke her day travel authorization in order to take with her to boston on december,triggering the breakdown in the parties communications.
even though petitioner changed his mind and decided that he did not want to move to boston,the record establishes that the last shared intent of the parties was for their son to relocate permanently with his mother soon after finished the argentine school year in december.the unilateral wishes of
