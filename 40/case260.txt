plaintiff iván rocafort is the president and primary shareholder of pleasures of san patricio,psp,a tobacco and wine shop in puerto rico psp regularly imports and sells little cigars made in the mainland united states and is the exclusive distributor of cheyenne little cigars in puerto rico.the united states department of the treasury has classified little cigars as a different tobacco product from cigarettes.section of the puerto rico internal revenue code imposes an excise tax on cigarettes but not on little cigars.prior to,psp had never been required to pay puerto rico cigarette excise tax on its imported little cigars.in,psp ordered worth of cheyenne little cigars from a manufacturer in north carolina.defendant secretary of the puerto rico department of the treasury,juan,for the first time refused to release psp shipment of cheyenne little cigars until psp paid the cigarette excise tax.psp alleges defendant acted pursuant to circular letter of internal revenue dated august,circular letter which psp claims imposes puerto rico cigarette tax only on little cigars produced in the united states.
in october,psp filed suit in puerto rico federal district court requesting the immediate release of psp shipment of cheyenne little cigars,a permanent injunction against the selective and discriminatory imposition of the cigarette excise tax upon cheyenne little cigars and a declaration that the excise tax of the internal revenue code of puerto rico section is not applicable to cheyenne little cigars.psp asserted defendant application of the cigarette excise tax solely to little cigars constitutes unconstitutional interference with and discrimination against interstate commerce,in violation of the commerce clause,article i,section of the united states constitution.
the district court granted defendant motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in august.the district court concluded the butler act,prevented it from hearing the suit because the act prohibits the filing of suits in federal courts for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax imposed by the laws of puerto rico.pleasures of san patricio,dkt.no.civ,wl,at,quoting.the court was firmly convinced that this is a prototypical butler act case as psp is explicitly challenging the validity of a tax and defendant authority to assess it.id.consequently,the district court declared it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the suit.id.at.psp timely appeal to our court followed.
at oral argument,counsel for both parties revealed that while this appeal was pending,psp filed an action in a commonwealth of puerto rico trial court and received a partial summary judgment,which was at that time on appeal to the commonwealth appellate court.we,therefore,ordered both parties to file english translations of the proceedings and associated complaints,pleadings,motions and briefs in psp related case before the commonwealth trial and appellate courts.defendant responded to our order by filing pages in no apparent order without a uniform page numbering system some page numbers are handwritten,others are typed in various fonts and sizes,and some placed over the page text.defendant evidently thought it appropriate to divide the documents into six parts but failed to label any of these six parts.defendant provides an addendum index which does not appear to correspond to what it actually filed.looking at the first page and last page of each part,part ii allegedly contains pages through part iii allegedly contains pages through part iv allegedly contains pages through part v allegedly contains pages through and part vi allegedly contains pages through.as for pages through,we are left to assume they are somewhere in those six parts although,we have only been able to locate pages numbered through scattered throughout the six parts because many of the pages lack page numbers altogether.
under,we review the district court final order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction de novo.murphy united states,cir.in light of the proceedings in the commonwealth courts,we suspect this case is moot.the parties inadequate compliance with our order,however,prevents us from definitively reaching a conclusion as to mootness.regardless,we can definitively conclude based upon the submissions that we lack subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the butler act because commonwealth of puerto rico courts have provided a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy.we,consequently,affirm the district court dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.
from what we can decipher,psp apparently filed a lawsuit in the commonwealth of puerto rico in february,after the federal district court dismissed the instant case,against the puerto rico department of the treasury and department of justice challenging the circular letter,requesting an injunction,and demanding damages for the unlawful detention of its shipment.see rocafort dep t of the treasury,no.court of first instance,caguas superior court,filed february.psp alleged defendant implemented the circular letter in contravention of puerto rico small business administrative and regulatory flexibility act sbarfa.the court of first instance granted partial summary judgment and entered a judgment in psp favor.the court considered whether defendant acted in conformity with the sbarfa in issuing the circular letter and,if properly issued,whether the circular letter promulgates an invalid administrative interpretation of section of the internal revenue code.psp does not appear to have raised commerce clause arguments before the court of first instance.ultimately,the court concluded defendant acted in contravention of the sbarfa in issuing the circular letter and relied upon an invalid regulatory interpretation in seizing the shipment of little cigars.the court,therefore,granted psp motion for partial summary judgment and ordered the department of the treasury to release the shipment immediately.defendants then filed a petition for certiorari before the commonwealth of puerto rico appellate court.see rocafort dep t of the treasury,no,petition for certiorari appellate court,judicial region of caguas,filed october.that is the last documentation we have of this case in the commonwealth courts.neither party has supplemented the record pursuant to fed.j to inform us whether the appellate court has granted the petition for certiorari,let alone whether it has affirmed the court of first instance partial summary judgment in favor of psp.the parties have also not informed us whether the department of the treasury has complied with the court of first instance september order by releasing the shipment.as a result,we can not conclusively determine that the commonwealth proceedings render the case before us moot.we,therefore,proceed to determine whether the butler act deprives us of subject matter jurisdiction.
the butler act states,in relevant part no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax imposed by the laws of puerto rico shall be maintained in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.the act is a close analogue to the tax injunction act tia applicable to puerto rico.coors brewing,cir.the two statutes employ different language the tia includes an express exception that the butler act lacks,but have been construed in pari materia.united parcel,cir quoting trailer marine transp.rivera vazquez,cir.for this reason,we apply the butler act in the same manner as the tia.carrier perez,cir.the tia limits the jurisdiction of a federal court to entertain a suit seeking to enjoin the levying or collection of a state tax where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy exists in state court.id.at see also united parcel,at.two conditions must,therefore,be satisfied before the butler act will deprive a federal court of jurisdiction first,the suit must attempt to restrain the assessment or collection of a puerto rico tax and second,local courts must provide the plaintiff a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy.carrier,at.
as to the first condition,similar to the tia,n ot every statutory or regulatory obligation that may aid the secretary of the treasury ability to collect a tax is immune from attack in federal court by virtue of the butler act jurisdictional bar.united parcel,at.the act jurisdictional bar only extends to 
c ases where taxpayers were repeatedly using the federal courts to raise questions of state or federal law going to the validity of the particular taxes imposed upon to a case where a taxpayer contended that an unusual sanction for of a tax admittedly due violated his constitutional rights 
id.quoting wells malloy,cir.
in coors brewing,we further clarified the scope of the butler act in the wake of the supreme court decision in hibbs winn,d.hibbs winn dealt with the scope of the tia,but we concluded in coors 
s ince the butler act is read in parallel to the tia,and since it similarly only restricts the district courts from entertaining suits for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of taxes of puerto rico,we read it,according to hibbs,to only apply where plaintiffs seek to challenge taxes in a way that would reduce the flow of state tax revenue.
coors,at.for this reason,we concluded that despite the butler act the district court had jurisdiction to entertain coors suit challenging an exemption in puerto rico taxing scheme which specified a lower tax rate for small brewers generally local brewers.id.at.coors sought a declaration that the exemption was unconstitutional under the commerce clause as well as an injunction prohibiting the puerto rico secretary of the treasury from allowing any taxpayer to pay only the reduced tax rate provided by the small brewers exemption and requiring the secretary to impose the higher tax rate on all brewers.id.at.because coors did not seek to lower the tax rate on itself,rather than eliminat ing a potential source of revenue,the relief coors request ed would simply eliminate a tax law affording preferential tax treatment to certain taxpayers.id.at.accordingly,we concluded that under hibbs,coors action was not barred by the butler act.id.
at first blush,psp suit appears similar to the one we determined fell beyond the scope of the butler act in coors.psp raised a commerce clause objection to defendant placing a higher tax on little cigars than little cigars.similarly,coors raised a commerce clause challenge to the secretary imposing a higher tax on large brewers than on small brewers.but,critically,the two suits differ in the relief requested.coors requested an injunction requiring all brewers,large and small,to pay the higher tax,thereby increasing the revenue flowing to puerto rico.in contrast,psp requested in its amended complaint that the federal district court order the immediate release of psp shipment of cheyenne little cigars,issue a permanent injunction against the selective and discriminatory imposition of the cigarette excise tax upon cheyenne little cigars,and declare that the excise tax of the internal revenue code of puerto rico section is not applicable to cheyenne little cigars.psp did not request an injunction requiring defendant to apply the cigarette excise tax to all little cigars,including those made in puerto rico.consequently,rather than increase the revenue generated by puerto rico tax laws,psp requested relief would reduce the flow of puerto rico tax revenue.coors,at.we must,therefore,conclude psp suit does fall within the ambit of suits barred by the butler act.
now that we have determined psp suit is within the scope of suits barred by the butler act,we must decide whether puerto rico local courts provide a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy.carrier,at.psp argues in its briefs that it lacks such a remedy for two reasons first,puerto rico tax procedure requires it to sell its little cigars at a loss second,the supreme court of puerto rico does not recognize the applicability of the commerce clause to puerto rico 
the supreme court has clarified that the requirement of a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy in state court is only a procedural one and is,therefore,satisfied merely when certain procedural criteria are met.rosewell lasalle national bank,d carrier,at.a state remedy meets these minimal procedural criteria so long as it provides a taxpayer with a full hearing and judicial determination at which she may raise all constitutional objections to the tax and may therefrom seek review before the supreme court.rosewell,at.
puerto rico law evidently requires individuals contesting an imposed tax to pay the tax and then apply to the secretary of the treasury for a refund.see n o credit or reimbursement of any tax covered by and of this title shall be granted unless the taxpayer shows he has sustained the burden of the payment of the tax.carrier,at state refund actions that allow protesting taxpayers the opportunity for state judicial review of their constitutional and federal claims generally constitute a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy.see california grace brethren church,d great lakes dredge dock huffman.but puerto rico requires taxpayers not only to pay the tax before seeking redress,but also to in fact have suffered the economic burden of the tax.see also venrod sec y of the treasury of the commw.of puerto rico,n ot only must the plaintiff have paid the tax,but it must have in fact suffered the economic burden of the tax.quoting pedro pizá,tax court.if the secretary decides against the taxpayer,he may appeal the decision in the local puerto rico courts and,thereafter,seek review of any final commonwealth court decision with the supreme court of the united states.carrier,at.this means only taxpayers who have absorbed the challenged taxes and not passed them on to their vendees may sue for a refund in commonwealth courts.venrod.at.quoting venrod,psp asserts 
this puts a plaintiff in a situation anent the state remedy it can either pass the burden of the tax on to the ultimate purchaser,which will make the taxed product uncompetitive,and thereby forego any remedy for an allegedly illegal tax,or it can absorb the tax,sell the taxed product at a loss,and attempt to obtain a refund.
id.at.in venrod,the united states district court for the district of puerto rico reasoned that while we had previously determined in carrier that puerto rico refund procedure constituted a plain,speedy,and efficient remedy,we did not encounter the scenario described.id.as a result,the venrod district court proceeded to conclude a remedy which requires for its availability the selling of the taxed product at a loss is not plain,speedy,and efficient.id.in carrier,we reviewed the exact same puerto rico tax refund procedure under that the district court in venrod discussed we just did so seven years earlier carrier,at.at that time,we concluded that section provided plaintiffs challenging puerto rico taxes a plain,speedy and efficient remedy.id.the district court in venrod correctly noted that the carrier court did not expressly pass on the scenario section creates by requiring plaintiffs to suffer the challenged tax.venrod.at.however,we must assume that when the carrier court stated it had evaluated the puerto rico refund procedure in section,the court reviewed it in its brief entirety only two paragraphs long.we,therefore,have good reason to conclude we have already passed on section requirement.
moreover,we independently fail to see how requiring a taxpayer to sell taxed goods at a loss before suing for a refund fails to provide him an adequate remedy.first,if the taxpayer prevails in his challenge of the tax,he obtains a refund,reversing the detriment the tax imposed upon him.second,requiring a taxpayer to bear the burden of the tax does not diminish puerto rico satisfaction of the butler act minimal procedural requirements.puerto rico continues to satisfy those minimal procedural requirements by providing a taxpayer a full hearing and judicial determination of all of her constitutional objections to the tax,with review thereafter possible before the united states supreme court,regardless of its requirement.third,congress,and later the supreme court when asked to review state refund procedures,surely understood a taxpayer might have to bear the economic burden of a tax in order to contest it in state courts.when congress first passed the butle
