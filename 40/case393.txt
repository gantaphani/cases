appellant carmen,a career employee in the municipality of caguas the municipality,claimed that she was transferred from the public works department public works to the office of federal funds federal funds in violation of the first amendment and puerto rico law.although she enjoyed the same title and salary in the two positions,alleged that the transfer constituted a demotion because she had no significant work responsibilities at federal funds.she further alleged that the transfer was intended as retaliation because she complained of improper campaign tactics by the mayor and others in the municipal government,sparking an investigation by the puerto rico office of ethics ethics office.alternatively,she asserted that the transfer,motivated by her political affiliation,was an act of political discrimination.
prior to trial,the court granted summary judgment to defendants on the political discrimination claim.at trial,proceeded against mayor miranda marin and vice mayor wilfredo puig in their personal and official capacities on her retaliation claim,arguing that their actions supported liability against the municipality based on their final authority over her transfer.the court dismissed the retaliation claim against mayor marin as a matter of law at the completion of appellant case.although the jury found vice mayor puig not personally liable,it found the municipality liable on the retaliation claim.finding this jury verdict inconsistent with theory of the the liability of the municipality was contingent on the personal liability of the mayor or the vice district court entered judgment as a matter of law for the municipality.
we affirm in part,reverse in part and remand to the district court for further proceedings.specifically,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants on political discrimination claim.we also affirm the judgment in favor of vice mayor puig on retaliation claim and the decision of the district court vacating the jury award against the municipality.however,we order a new trial on retaliation claim against mayor marin and the municipality because the district court dismissal of the case against the mayor rested upon an erroneous evidentiary ruling involving the application of federal rule of evidence dealing with compromise and offers to compromise.that error was not harmless.
factual.transfer 
served as executive secretary for the director of public works,luisa flores,from until her transfer in in that position,she was required to open all incoming mail and enter it into a log.in,flores began receiving tickets to fundraisers and notices of leadership meetings for the popular democratic party pdp,the party to which both the mayor and flores belonged.suspected that the receipt of this material violated a rule prohibiting the use of government resources to further political campaigns.nevertheless,she duly logged the materials and delivered them to flores.
first discussed her concerns with flores in,but they were ignored.she then contacted a distant relative,roberto carrasquillo,who was a municipal assemblyman for the minority puerto rican independence party,pip.he confirmed the merit of her concerns and,with her permission,lodged a complaint with the ethics office.was summoned to the ethics office to testify concerning her complaint on december,and she complied.
on february,flores reprimanded in front of her for failing to perform one of her tasks.acknowledges that this reprimand was unrelated to her testimony in the ethics office investigation.upset,left the office early and did not return to work the next day.instead,she spent that day resting and on medication on february,she had a heated conversation with flores about the missed day of work shortly after that conversation,she passed out and required medical care.her doctor advised her to rest,which she did until february.on that date,delivered a copy of her medical release to the human resources office human resources.she then went to vice mayor wilfredo puig office to discuss the doctor recommendations and her intention to return to work.
the contents of the conversation between and vice mayor puig are hotly contested.according to,she told the vice mayor that,despite her doctor recommendation that she not return to public works,she wanted to return because she thought she could work things out with flores.she testified that vice mayor puig then told her that flores had showed him a copy of the mail log that kept and that the ethics office was investigating the use of municipal resources to distribute political propaganda.apparently unaware that had already testified before the ethics office on this matter,vice mayor puig suggested that she would be summoned to testify and asked her what she would say.at trial,testified i told him that i tell the truth.that i tell the truth because that was my job.according to,vice mayor puig told her that whatever truth i said could affect him,the mayor and the party,and i told him that i was very sorry,but that was my job.he then told her that he could no longer count on me.vice mayor puig recalled a very different conversation.he testified that requested a transfer out of public works and that there was no discussion of the ethics office investigation.
shortly after this meeting,was transferred out of her position at public works.after initial assignment to the municipal education department,where she had no work to do,she was transferred to federal funds.claims she did very little,practically nothing,at federal funds because the office already had an executive secretary she alleges that this lack of work was intended to encourage her to quit municipal employment altogether.testified that the lack of work made her feel bad,uncomfortable,ashamed,and depressed,and that it affected her home life i locked myself in,within that problem,and i could see beyond it and i forgot that the kids were growing up,that i had a husband,a mom,a family,and that became my life as a whole.in contrast,the director of federal funds,gilberto charriez,testified that his office was understaffed and desperate for workers when arrived and that she seemed happy in her new position.he also described ordering pizza on busy work nights when stayed late with the rest of the staff to meet deadlines,lunches eaten together in a conference room,office christmas parties and meeting family outside of work on social occasions.
attempts at reinstatement 
following her transfer,sent a letter to human resources dated march,requesting a written explanation for her transfer her attorney,eladio cartagena,followed up on this first letter with three additional letters.the first of these,dated march,was directed to the mayor.this letter requested reinstatement to public works and suggested that her transfer was motivated by the ethics office investigation.cartagena received a reply from human resources dated march that began,the william miranda marín,mayor,has referred to us your letter dated march,concerning the transfer of,and stated that the transfer had been made at request because of differences she had with her direct supervisor it was considered a temporary transfer and that we would have no inconvenience in newly reinstating to her former position.cartagena sent a second letter to the mayor on april,requesting the offered reinstatement receiving no response,he penned a third letter on may informing the mayor that,on the basis of the offered reinstatement,had met with the interim human resources director and the director of public works and that they had refused to reinstate her.the may letter also notified the mayor of intention to file a civil action based on mayor marin failure to reinstate her 
sometime thereafter,happened upon the mayor in a public square,where she approached him and asked about the resolution of her complaint.according to testimony,she grabbed him strongly and asked about her case.he responded what was my case,what was happening before she could elaborate,she was escorted back to her office by his assistants.finally,on june,wrote to the mayor again,complaining that she lacked significant work responsibilities and was depressed she entreated him to resolve her complaint and reinstate her to her former position.was never reinstated to her position at public works 
in his testimony as part of the defendants case,vice mayor puig maintained that he was never informed that opposed her transfer after their initial meeting,where he says she requested the change.he was asked there are many documents stating that rodriguez did not want the transfer,did you know that he replied they never came to my attention,none of them,stating that she did not want to go.
armando melendez,an executive in human resources who had met with at vice mayor puig behest,testified that expressed her desire not to be transferred during their meeting however,she called later that same day and said she did want the transfer.melendez written report on this meeting,dated february,and submitted as evidence at the trial,supports his testimony 
finally,heriberto martinez,who was director of the legal advisor office at the time of the transfer,testified that,upon request,he contacted human resources to look into her case.in a conversation with melendez,martinez was led to believe that would be reinstated to her position.martinez also spoke directly with vice mayor puig,who reiterated that had requested her initial transfer.when martinez reported to what he had been told,she reiterated that she wanted to return to public works.counsel pressed martinez on whether had said that she did not request the initial transfer,but martinez would testify only to her statement that she wanted to return to public works.
thus,there is a direct conflict between testimony and the account of the defendants.according to her,she never requested a transfer,and the transfer that was imposed upon her,to an office where she had no responsibilities,was in retaliation for her complaint to the ethics office.according to vice mayor puig,requested a transfer,supposedly because of her conflict with flores,and that was the last he heard of her employment predicament.according to melendez,initially requested not to be transferred but later called and requested a transfer.furthermore,according to her supervisor at federal funds,joined a busy office that was at the time of her transfer and where there was plenty of work to keep her busy.
procedural background 
in october,filed a petition in the superior court of puerto rico seeking an injunction against the municipality and luisa flores,alleging that she had been transferred in retaliation for her ethics office complaint,in violation of puerto rico law later filed and was granted a voluntary dismissal without prejudice.on november,she filed a new action in federal court against the municipality,mayor marin and vice mayor puig,claiming that she had been transferred and demoted on the basis of her political affiliation the political discrimination claim and her involvement in the ethics office investigation the retaliation claim,in violation of the first amendment and puerto rico law.she brought her federal law claims under,and.
defendants moved for summary judgment on a number of grounds.in an august opinion and order,the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part in particular,the court found that had not established a prima facie case of political discrimination under the first amendment and that her claims under and were inapt because she had not alleged any discriminatory action based on race or class however,the district court found that had placed sufficient facts in dispute to warrant a jury trial on the retaliation claim and that these factual disputes foreclosed a ruling at that stage on the mayor and vice mayor claimed entitlement to qualified immunity.motions and for reconsideration were filed and denied.
before the trial commenced,defendants filed a motion in limine to exclude the testimony of several witnesses and the letters under federal rule of evidence,which excludes conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations regarding a claim that was disputed.a,a.the court denied the motion as to the testimony and allowed the letters into evidence,but only for the limited purpose of negating defendants contention that plaintiff herself requested a transfer.
at the close of the plaintiff case,mayor marin requested and was granted judgment as a matter of law in his personal capacity under federal rule of civil procedure a.noting that the letters could not be relied upon as evidence of the mayor notice of her claim because of the limited ground of their admission,the court explained that the remaining evidence,a mere letter of protest and request to human resources for investigation which was ignored by a supervising authority,was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that the mayor knew of employment situation and thus he could not be found liable for any participation in her transfer and lack of reinstatement.
at the trial conclusion,the jury rejected claim that vice mayor puig had taken an adverse employment action against her.however,it did find that she had established municipal liability for that adverse employment action and awarded her in damages.in response to the municipality motion,the court granted judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b,finding the jury verdict inconsistent with theory of the case.the court denied motion to vacate judgment and,alternatively,for a new trial,and she proceeded with this appeal.
challenges each of the district court dispositive rulings the grant of summary judgment for defendants on her political discrimination claim the grant of the rule a motion dismissing the case against mayor marin in his personal capacity and the decision to grant judgment as a matter of law to the municipality.she also challenges the jury verdict in favor of vice mayor puig.with respect to the municipality,she contends that either the jury verdict should be restored or that she is entitled to a new trial on her claim against mayor marin,vice mayor puig and the municipality.she insists that the verdict in favor of vice mayor puig was against the weight of the evidence.
a.the political discrimination claim 
we review the grant of summary judgment on the political discrimination claim de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of,cir.as a necessary element of establishing a prima facie case of political discrimination,a plaintiff must show that party affiliation or advocacy of political ideas was a substantial or motivating factor behind the challenged employment action.santiago,cir.
the district court granted summary judgment to defendants because it found that plaintiff fluid political affiliation makes it difficult for the court to find that defendants were well aware and motivated by her alleged support for the party in opposition to the mayor party.indeed,testified at her deposition that,while she claims to be a member of the pip,she voted for candidates from several parties in the elections she also admitted that she acted as an electoral college official for the mayor party,the pdp,in the elections.
on appeal,does not contest the court characterization of her partisan affiliation rather,she attempts to shift the basis of her political discrimination claim from political affiliation to political speech.however,this attempt at recharacterization makes her political discrimination claim indistinguishable from her retaliation claim,which focuses on the defendants reaction to her discussions with the ethics office.as presented to the district court at the time of its summary judgment ruling,her political discrimination claim was dependent upon establishing that defendants were aware of and motivated by her political affiliation.we agree with the district court that the plaintiff did not establish a genuine issue of material fact on the relationship between her transfer and her political affiliation.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for defendants on this claim.
reinstatement of the jury verdict 
urges us to reinstate the jury verdict against the municipality,arguing that the court erred when it found the verdict inconsistent with her theory of the case.the district court characterized case as depending on retaliation taken against her by mayor marin and vice mayor puig,as parties with final authority to bind the municipality.since the claim against the mayor had already been dismissed,the court viewed municipal liability as contingent upon vice mayor puig liability.therefore,the jury rejection of the claim against vice mayor puig made municipal liability inconsistent with theory of the case.
on appeal,argues that the jury could have based municipal liability on the actions of a conspiracy of municipal workers,including but not limited to vice mayor puig.seen through the lens of this alternative theory,the jury verdicts are not necessarily inconsistent,and the judgment against the municipality should be reinstated 
the municipality argues that failure to object to the judge inconsistency determination before the jury was dismissed bars our review of this issue.we agree.we have followed an rule that a party that fails to raise an objection based on verdict inconsistency before the jury is dismissed waives the issue.see wennik polygram group distribution,cir rivera,cir toucet.overseas,cir collecting cases.here we confront the opposite situation failed to specifically voice her opinion that the verdict was consistent before the jury was dismissed.
in the typical case,it would be pointless to require a party to assert that a favorable verdict was consistent.however,this is not the typical case.here,the district court had twice indicated that,if the jury found vice mayor puig not liable and the municipality liable,it would enter judgment for the municipality as a matter of law.
first,after the jury instructions were read,the defense noted that the instructions did not preclude the jury from finding in favor of vice mayor puig but against the municipality.the court responded if they do find vice mayor puig liable and for some reason they find the municipality liable the municipality is not liable.did not object to this statement at the time she also failed to object to this statement shortly thereafter,when specifically asked if she had objections to preserve.
second,after closing arguments,the court gave the parties an opportunity to represerve their earlier objections.the defense again raised its concern that the jury instructions allowed for a mixed verdict.the court responded okay,but i told you that if for all purposes they find puig not liable,as a matter of law i am going to have the municipality dismissed.so that is not going to be a problem.the defense then stated i understand,your honor,and i think that we all agree with that matter,the parties agree,the plaintiff agreed also,so no problem.again raised no objection on this point,though she preserved other objections.
after the verdict was delivered and the jurors were duly polled,again remained silent.the court discharged the jury and then declared that it would enter judgment for the municipality.although finally tried to argue that the jury verdict was consistent,it was too late.by failing to preserve an objection to the court inconsistent verdict determination before the jury was discharged,has waived her right to argue on appeal that the court erred in that determination.see rullan,cir finding failure to object before the moment of jury discharge constituted a waiver correia fitzgerald,cir holding that a failure to object to an alleged inconsistency while the jury is still empaneled constituted waiver.
arguments for a new trial 
argues that,in the event we decline to reinstate the verdict against the municipality,we should grant her a new trial against all parties,claiming that the district court erred in dismissing the claims against mayor marin and that a new trial is warranted against vice mayor puig because the jury verdict in his favor was against the weight of the evidence.
dismissal of the case against mayor marin 
the court dismissed the claims against mayor marin in his personal capacity,finding that,while the mayor can in principle be held liable under a theory of failing to act or take necessary steps to remedy her predicament,had not provided sufficient evidence to establish that the mayor was aware of her situation.municipal officials may only be held liable under in their personal capacity if the plaintiff can establish that her constitutional injury resulted from the direct acts or omissions of the official,or from indirect conduct that amounts to condonation or tacit authorization.whitfield,cir.on either theory,the plaintiff must show that the official had actual or constructive notice of the constitutional violation.see lipsett of,cir an important factor in making the determination of liability is whether the official was put on some kind of notice of the alleged violations,for one can not make a deliberate or conscious choice to act or not to act unless confronted with a problem that requires the taking of affirmative steps.quoting pembaur city of cincinnati,d.in seeking to convince the court that the mayor knew of her employment situation,relied principally on the letters,particularly the march letter from human resources suggesting that the mayor had referred her claim to its attention.rejecting this argument,the court noted that it had admitted the letters for the limited purpose of establishing that did not request a transfer from public works and thus the letters could not be used to establish the mayor knowledge of her situation.with the letters excluded,the court found that the remaining evidence was insufficient to establish that the mayor was aware of her situation and hence had any direct or indirect involvement in her transfer,lack of reinstatement,or minimal work assignments.
we review the court rule a ruling de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to.dirico city of quincy,cir.however,because that ruling depends upon the correctness of the court decision to limit the admissibility of the letters,we must first evaluate the court evidentiary ruling,which we review for abuse of discretion.see pelletier main textiles,lp,cir.
admission of the letters for a limited purpose 
in their motion in limine,appellees argued that the letters should be excluded under federal rule of evidence,which prohibits the use of statements made in compromise negotiations regarding the claim as evidence of a party liability for a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount.a,a.at a hearing on the motion,the court initially stated 
i t is my impression that these do not fall under rule these are the sort of letters that when anything happens regarding personnel,the attorney starts to write the agency to put them on notice.the agency,the municipality in this case,will respond,we noted your letter.we are going to look into this.then the attorney will say,oh,you have done this or you have done that.
although the court seemed inclined to reject defendants arguments that the letters were covered by rule,attorney began her arguments against the motion in limine by focusing on an exception to rule that allows evidence offered for a purpose other than showing liability.specifically,she argued that t he letters were being introduced into evidence for the limited purpose of proving that defendants in fact knew that rodriguez garcia did not want the transfer and that they were aware that she did not want the transfer.
despite this inauspicious beginning,attorney arguments developed over the course of the hearing on the motion.by the end,she clearly contested the relevance of rule to the letters.indeed,just before the court announced that it would recess to deliberate,her attorney urged the court to examine the four letters together 
you can not look at each letter individually you see,cartagena directed a letter to the mayor.and the mayor,and very wisely by his counsel,is trying to take himself out of the picture saying it has nothing to do with me,i did exercise any action,i did do anything,i did sign the letter,i did send the letter.but you read the letter from human resources,the first thing that it says is,the honorable william miranda marin,mayor,has referred to us your letter dated march,concerning the transfer of rodriguez.this is evidence of liability against the mayor.emphasis added.
defense counsel responded that why rule does not permit the letter to come into evidence.attorney countered this letter is not an admission it is not a compromise.read it.thus,by the end of the hearing,the court was on notice that intended to use the letters as proof of the mayor liability and not merely as evidence that she did not request her transfer.nonetheless,in a written ruling after the recess,the court a ssume d that the communications at issue were indeed compromise related and it admitted the letters for the limited purpose of negating defendants contention that plaintiff herself requested a transfer.
this limitation,erroneous as a matter of law,was an abuse of discretion.see charlesbank equity fund ii blinds to go,cir noting that legal error always constitutes abuse of discretion.the court initial impression that these letters do not fall under rule was correct.these letters can not reasonably be viewed as statements made in compromise negotiations regarding a claim that was in dispute.a.the march letter from attorney to the mayor office served the purpose of giving the defendants notice of a claim.indeed,appellees acknowledged that attorney had to write such a letter to comply with local notice requirements.the march letter from human resources,which said that the william miranda marín,mayor,has referred to us your letter dated march,concerning the transfer of,simply acknowledged that notice of the claim had been received and expressed the willingness of human resources to grant request for reinstatement.
although human resources disputed a factual matter that had not requested a transfer,that disagreement did not affect their willingness to grant to her,without qualification or condition,the reinstatement that she sought.with receiving in this letter exactly what she wanted,it could easily be thought there were no compromise negotiations taking place in this exchange of correspondence within the meaning of rule.see,collegiate dictionary ed defining compromise as a settlement of differences reached by mutual concessions.see also sandlin shapiro fishman,finding that letters whose contents offered no concessions did not meet the definition of compromise and thus were outside the scope of the state analog to rule.relatedly,the statement at issue here the william miranda marin,mayor,has referred to us your letter dated march,concerning the transfer of rodriguez is not the kind of statement that one would be reluctant to make to a potential adversary in an effort to reach an agreement about a dispute without the protection of rule.indeed,if a letter of acknowledgment had been written confirming receipt and noting that the mayor office had referred the claim to human resources,there is no question that the letter would have been admissible as evidence of notice to the mayor of claim.thus,admitting this evidence complies with both the letter and spirit of rule.
the second letter from attorney to the mayor,dated april,simply reiterated the request for the transfer.when no reinstatement was forthcoming,her attorney sent a third letter dated may,announcing his intention to file a lawsuit.these letters too are outside the ambit of rule.therefore,should have been permitted to use the letters as evidence that the mayor personally had notice of her claims,an indispensable element of her theory of liability,rather than simply as evidence that she had not requested a transfer from public works.
harmless error 
it is a short step from the determination that the district court erred in its decision to limit the admissibility of the letters to a determination that it erred in granting the mayor judgment as a matter of law.the district court,having excluded the letters,determined that the remaining march complaint letter sent to human resources and the encounter between and the mayor in a public insufficient to establish supervisory liability.the court explained i f mere receipt of a letter or similar complaint were enough,without more,to constitute personal involvement,it would result in liability merely for being a supervisor,which is contrary to the law that does not impose respondeat superior liability.quoting johnson wright,d.given the state of the record that prompted this observation,we understand the court reference to the mere receipt of a letter to be a reference to the march letter to the acting director of human resources.
we appreciate the reluctance to permit a jury to draw an inference about the personal involvement of the mayor on the basis of a letter sent to a department head.however,if the court had correctly admitted the letters as evidence of the mayor knowledge of complaint and his personal involvement in dealing with it,the court could no longer maintain that was attempting to establish the mayor liability based simply on his role as the supervisor of a department head.instead,she would have had a basis for arguing that the mayor knew about and was directly involved in the disposition of her transfer and the failure to remedy it.although appellees argue strenuously that there was no evidence that the mayor personally received the letters sent to him,this is a factual question appropriate for jury determination.
moreover,because the district court erred in dismissing the case against the mayor in his personal capacity,it also improperly hindered case against the municipality.it is well established that the deliberate acts or omissions of a municipal policymaker with final authority over the subject matter in question may expose the municipality itself to liability.see pembaur,at.explaining that municipal liability can be found on a plaintiff showing of a deliberate choice to follow a course of action made by the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in question.we have repeatedly recognized that mayors in puerto rico are the government officials ultimately responsible for the employment decisions of the municipality.ortiz velez,cir see also cordero de,cir.if could establish the mayor liability in his personal capacity,she would have a plausible argument for municipal liability as well.under these circumstances,the limited relevance accorded by the district court to the letters on the basis of rule was not a harmless error.
the verdict in favor of vice mayor puig 
also urges us to overturn the verdict in favor of vice mayor puig,arguing that the jury could not have made a credibility determination in favor of vice mayor puig given the weight of the evidence suggesting that had consistently opposed her transfer.we disagree.
the question of vice mayor puig liability turned largely on whether the jury credited vice mayor puig or testimony concerning the conversations that allegedly took place between them.indeed,closing argument featured a series of rhetorical questions,asking 
who do you believe you heard carmen,but no,the vice mayor tells us that on february carmen rodriguez requested a transfer to federal funds.who hears him who remembers who do you believe shall we believe wilfredo puig,who very conveniently remembers that carmen requested to go to federal funds should we believe wilfredo puig,that conveniently understood that carmen had no hospitalizations after getting to federal funds who will we believe wilfredo puig,who again,understood that he could testify as to assigned personnel action,that he later stipulated that did not exist,and that he later admitted that he had never seen.who do we believe what happened on february,what 
assessing witness credibility is within the unique province of the jury.united states thomas,cir.we will not disturb its verdict in favor of vice mayor puig.
for the reasons set forth above,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for defendants on political discrimination claim.we also reject request that we order reinstatement of the verdict against the municipality,concluding that failed to make the necessary objection before the jury was discharged.however,we find that the court erred when it dismissed the case against the mayor based on its rule r
