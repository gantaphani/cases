as a participant in the federal medicaid program,the state of california has agreed to abide by certain requirements imposed by federal law in return for federal financial assistance in furnishing medical care to the needy.see harris mcrae,d.the california medical assistance program,welf,represents california implementation of the federal medicaid program robert kennedy medical center belshé cal th,d.in implementing,our legislature has enacted statutes authorizing a health care provider to assert and collect on a lien for the full cost of its services against any judgment,award,or settlement obtained by a medicaid beneficiary.see also.
the legislature enacted these statutes to alleviate the fiscal difficulties faced by health care providers who,due to payment limits,did not receive full compensation for services rendered to medicaid beneficiaries see legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.stats,summary,and to give these providers an incentive to seek out liability sources assem.health,on assem.bill reg.sess.as originally enacted in,section allowed a provider to first bill and,after receiving payment from,to file a lien for the amount of unpaid charges against any judgment,award,or settlement obtained by the beneficiary stats,ch.recognizing that this balance billing provision might conflict with federal law,however,the legislature provided that t he provisions for which appropriate federal waivers can not be obtained such as section shall not be implemented.stats,ch.
because no federal waivers were obtained,the version of section was never implemented.see assem.ways means,republican analysis of bill.reg.sess.in,the legislature sought to rectify this problem by revising section.under the version,a provider could recover on a lien against any judgment,award,or settlement obtained by the medicaid beneficiary for the full cost of its services only after refunding the payment.thus,the version permitted substitute the provider substitutes recovery from a judgment or settlement obtained by the beneficiary for recovery from not balance billing.unlike in,the legislature did not condition implementation of the version on the receipt of appropriate federal waivers.
today we consider the constitutionality of the version of the provider lien statute in the context of a lawsuit filed by a beneficiary against her medical provider.in this case,the health care provider filed a lien pursuant to section against the beneficiary.challenging the legality of the provider practice of filing such liens,the beneficiary filed a class action lawsuit against the provider,alleging unfair competition and various tort claims.as the basis for her claims,the beneficiary contended federal law preempted section and rendered invalid any liens filed pursuant to that section.the trial court dismissed the action,holding that federal medicaid law did not preempt section.we now conclude that the trial court erred in part because federal law does preempt california provider lien statutes.nonetheless,we affirm the judgment of the trial court dismissing the class action with prejudice because the claims either fall within the safe harbor described in communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,or are barred by the litigation privilege contained in civil code section,subdivision b.
because we review this case after the trial court sustained a general demurrer,we accept as true all material allegations of the complaint.see charles vacanti,state comp.ins.fund cal th,d.the complaint alleges the following facts 
cimarron olszewski plaintiff is a minor and a beneficiary who received emergency medical care from scripps health defendant,a medical care provider that participates in the program.defendant received and accepted payments for the medical care it provided to plaintiff.defendant,either directly or through its collection agent,medical liabilities recoveries,mlr collectively defendants also asserted a lien against the personal injury claims,judgments or settlements of plaintiff pursuant to welfare and institutions code section and civil code section.
in response,plaintiff filed this class action,alleging that defendants had no legal right to assert and collect on such liens in light of federal medicaid law governing provider reimbursement and third party liability.plaintiff asserted causes of action for violations of the unfair competition law hereafter ucl bus,et,trespass to chattels,negligent misrepresentation,and fraud.in addition to restitution and damages,plaintiff sought an order declaring that the liens asserted by defendants against her and the other class members were unlawful,unenforceable,and uncollectible because federal law preempted the california statutes authorizing these liens.plaintiff also sought to enjoin defendants from asserting these liens in the future.
defendants demurred,and the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend.the court concluded that defendants had a statutory right to assert the liens under section and that federal law did not preempt this statutory right.the court also held that plaintiff tort claims were barred because the filing of the liens was a privileged communication protected by civil code section,subdivision b.
the court of appeal disagreed with the trial court on the preemption issue and concluded that federal medicaid law preempted section.the court,however,agreed that plaintiff claims were barred because section provided a safe harbor from plaintiff ucl claim under,supra,cal th at page,d,and defendants assertion of the liens was protected by the litigation privilege.in determining the proper disposition,the court concluded that the trial court had found an imbedded claim for declaratory relief as to the validity of section and had declared section was not preempted by federal law and defendants lien against plaintiff was valid.the court of appeal then modified the declaratory relief portion of the trial court judgment to reflect its findings that federal law preempted section and defendants lien was invalid and unenforceable and affirmed the judgment as so modified.
both plaintiff and defendants petitioned this court and we granted review.
discussion 
as an initial matter,we find that the court of appeal acted properly in modifying the judgment to include a declaration that defendants lien against plaintiff was invalid,but erred in adding a declaration that federal law preempted section.in her complaint,plaintiff adequately pled a claim for declaratory relief under code of civil procedure section even though she did not separately identify such a cause of action.bank of america.gillett d,gillett affirming a judgment awarding declaratory relief even though the plaintiff failed to designate his complaint one for declaratory relief see also witkin,cal.procedure ed pleading,because there are no forms of action,a declaration of rights will be upheld if the complaint states sufficient facts even though the pleader did not think he was proceeding under and did not appropriately label his complaint.the complaint asked the court to adjudge the rights and duties of plaintiff and defendants with respect to defendants lien and alleged facts establishing an actual controversy appropriate for declaratory relief.wellenkamp bank of america cal d.as such,plaintiff was entitled to a declaration of her rights and duties under defendants lien.see gillett,at.and,upon concluding that defendants lien against plaintiff was invalid and unenforceable,the court of appeal properly modified the judgment to include a declaration to that effect.see essick city of los angeles cal d,modifying a judgment to include declaratory relief even though the trial court dismissed the complaint without specifically awarding declaratory relief.
the court of appeal,however,erred by modifying the judgment to include a declaration addressing the constitutionality of section.in her complaint,plaintiff never sought a declaration that federal law preempted section she only sought a declaration that defendants liens were invalid.thus,in modifying the judgment,the court should have only included a declaration that defendants lien against plaintiff was invalid,unenforceable,and not that section was preempted.
nonetheless,the court of appeal did not exceed its jurisdiction by deciding the preemption issue.in a convoluted argument,defendant contends the court erroneous resolution of the imbedded declaratory relief claim somehow invalidated its finding of preemption because defendant had no opportunity to litigate the claim.defendant is mistaken.in determining whether defendants lien was invalid,the court of appeal had to determine whether federal law preempted california provider lien statutes.moreover,the trial court,in sustaining the demurrers,expressly held that federal law did not preempt section.thus,the court of appeal properly considered and decided the preemption issue in reviewing the trial court order sustaining the demurrers.in any event,defendant fully briefed the preemption issue before the court of appeal and the trial court.under these circumstances,defendant can hardly claim that it lacked an adequate opportunity to litigate the preemption issue.
similarly,defendant contention that the court of appeal erred by deciding the federal preemption issue without making the state of california a party to this action must be rejected.code of civil procedure section,subdivision a states in relevant part that a person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if in his absence complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties thus,a person is an indispensable party only when the judgment to be rendered necessarily must affect his rights.hartman ranch associated oil cal d.in this case,the court could grant the relief requested by plaintiff without injuring or affecting the rights of the state of california.plaintiff did not assert an imbedded claim for declaratory relief seeking to invalidate section.see ante,at.rather,she sought to invalidate the liens filed by defendants pursuant to that section the state of california had no interest in these liens and could not recover on them.the fact that an adverse ruling against defendants may have a financial impact on the state or require a finding that federal law preempts a california statute does not make the state an indispensable party.see hartenstine superior court d.finding that the state of california was not an indispensable party despite its interest in enforcing its laws.
we now consider defendant substantive challenge to the court of appeal declaration that defendants lien against plaintiff filed pursuant to section was invalid,unenforceable,and uncollectible.plaintiff concedes that california law permits provider liens against the personal injury claims,judgments or settlements of medicaid beneficiaries.she,however,contends these liens,such as the liens filed by defendants,are unenforceable because federal law preempts the statutes authorizing these liens.we agree.
we begin with a brief overview of medicaid and.in,congress established medicaid by enacting title xix of the social security act see schweiker gray panthers,d schweiker.the medicaid program is a cooperative endeavor in which the federal government provides financial assistance to participating states to aid them in furnishing health care to needy persons.under this system of cooperative federalism,citation if a state agrees to establish a medicaid plan the federal government agrees to pay a specified percentage of the total amount expended as medical assistance under the state plan harris mcrae,supra,at.participation is voluntary,but once a state elects to participate,it must comply with the requirements of title xix.id.at.
although the requirements of title xix are described in detail in united states code section see pennsylvania medical society snider cir,snider,construing these requirements is often easier said than done.the social security act is among the most intricate ever drafted by congress.its byzantine construction makes the act almost unintelligible to the uninitiated.schweiker,supra,at.indeed,a federal judge once described the medicaid statutes as an aggravated assault on the english language,resistant to attempts to understand it.friedman berger,affd.cir.because of the extraordinary complexity of these statutes,congress has conferred on the secretary of health and human services hereafter secretary exceptionally broad authority to prescribe standards for applying certain sections of the act.schweiker,at.see,a a a state plan for medical assistance must provide such methods of administration as are found by the secretary to be necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan.regulations promulgated by the secretary are therefore entitled to legislative effect unless they exceed his or her statutory authority or are arbitrary or capricious.schweiker,at.state medicaid plans must therefore comply with requirements imposed both by the social security act itself and by the secretary id.at,and must be approved by the secretary elizabeth blackwell health center knoll cir,elizabeth blackwell center.
despite these requirements,t he medicaid program was designed to provide the states with a degree of flexibility in designing plans that meet their individual needs.citation.as such,states are given considerable latitude in formulating the terms of their own medical assistance plans.addis whitburn cir.congress intended that states be allowed flexibility in developing procedures for administering their statutory obligations under the medicaid statute and their state plans.elizabeth blackwell center,supra,at.
with this backdrop in mind,we now turn to the medicaid statutes and regulations governing provider reimbursement and third party liability.a state medicaid plan must establish a scheme for reimbursing health care providers for the medical services provided to needy individuals,and must require that payment for medicaid services be made only to the provider of the services or,under certain conditions,to the recipient of the services.banks secretary of indiana family soc.serv.cir,see also a.the plan and the state agency administering that plan must ensure that the rate is reasonable and adequate to meet the costs that must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities to provide services in conformity with state and federal laws,regulations,and quality and safety standards.a.to receive reimbursement from a state medicaid plan,a health care provider must enter into a provider agreement with the state medicaid agency.see a.
because medicaid is essentially a payer of last resort rehabilitation ass of kozlowski cir,federal medicaid law requires state plans to recover from liable third parties whenever possible.a t hird party is any individual,entity or program that is or may be liable to pay all or part of the expenditures for medical assistance furnished under a state plan,italics added.the state medicaid agency must take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties a a.i n any case where such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual and where the amount of reimbursement the state can reasonably expect to recover exceeds the costs of such recovery,the state or local agency must seek reimbursement for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability a b.to that end,the state plan must provide for the mandatory assignment of the beneficiary rights to payment for medical care from any third party to the state agency.a a see also a.
thus,when a health care provider submits a medicaid claim,the state medicaid agency must first ascertain whether a third party may be liable.if the agency has established the probable existence of third party liability at the time the claim is filed,the agency must reject the claim and return it to the provider for a determination of the amount of liability when the amount of liability is determined,the agency must then pay the claim to the extent that payment allowed under the agency payment schedule exceeds the amount of the third party payment.b.if the probable existence of third party liability can not be established or third party benefits are not available to pay the recipient medical expenses at the time the claim is filed,the agency must pay the full amount allowed under the agency payment schedule.c.the agency must then pursue recovery of reimbursement from that third party.d.
while federal law requires the state medicaid agency to obtain full reimbursement of medicaid payments whenever possible,it strictly limits the ability of providers to obtain reimbursement for their services.even though medicaid payments are typically lower than the amounts normally charged by providers for their services see mcamis wallace,a state plan must provide that the medicaid agency must limit participation in the medicaid program to providers who accept,as payment in full,the amounts paid by the agency plus any deductible,coinsurance or copayment required by the plan to be paid by the individual,italics added section a c of title united states code service then provides that in the case of an individual who is entitled to medical assistance under the state plan with respect to a service for which a third party is liable for payment,the person furnishing the service may not seek to collect from the individual or any financially responsible relative or representative of that individual payment of an amount for that service except under specific circumstances and in limited amounts defined by the statute italics added see also a.
to comply with these federal requirements,has imposed certain limitations on provider reimbursement.under section,subdivision c,u pon presentation of the card or other proof of eligibility,the provider shall submit a claim for reimbursement any provider of health care services who obtains a label or copy from the card or other proof of eligibility shall not seek reimbursement nor attempt to obtain payment for the cost of those covered health care services from the eligible applicant or recipient,or any person other than the department or a payor who provides a contractual or legal entitlement to health care services,subd.a.
despite these limitations on provider reimbursement,section,subdivision a provides subject to the director prior right of recovery,a provider who has rendered services to a beneficiary because of an injury for which a third party is liable and who has received payment under the program shall be entitled to file a lien for all fees for services provided to the beneficiary against any judgment,award,or settlement obtained by the beneficiary or the director against that third party.a provider may only recover upon the lien if the provider has made a full reimbursement of any fees paid by the department the state agency that administers for those services.in the event of judgment or award in a suit or claim against a third party or carrier,the provider may collect on the lien.we now consider whether federal law preempts these provider lien statutes.
as acknowledged by plaintiff,sections and authorized the liens filed by defendant.nonetheless,plaintiff contends the liens are unenforceable because federal medicaid statutes and regulations limiting provider united states code service section a c and code of federal regulations parts and these california statutes we agree.
under the united states constitution,the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,art.vi,cl.since mcculloch maryland wheat,it has been settled that state law that conflicts with federal law is without effect.smiley citibank cal th,d,smiley,affd,d,quoting cipollone liggett group,d cipollone.and both federal statutes and regulations may have preemptive effect.see fidelity federal sav.loan de la cuesta,d federal regulations have no less effect than federal statutes.
a federal statute or regulation may preempt state law in three situations,commonly referred to as express preemption,field preemption,and conflict preemption.first,congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citations.second,in the absence of explicit statutory language,state law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively.citations.finally,state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.citations.smiley,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted,quoting english general electric,d english.
a state law actually conflicts with federal law where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements citation,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.english,supra,at,quoting hines davidowitz.what is a sufficient obstacle is a matter of judgment,to be informed by examining the federal statute as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects.crosby national foreign trade council,d.
although federal law may preempt state law,c ourts are reluctant to infer preemption,and it is the burden of the party claiming that congress intended to preempt state law to prove it.elsworth beech aircraft cal d.where congress has legislated in a field traditionally occupied by the states,we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.rice santa fe elevator.this assumption provides assurance that the balance citation will not be disturbed unintentionally by congress or unnecessarily by the courts.jones rath packing,d.in applying this assumption,courts should narrowly interpret the scope of congress intended invalidation of state law whenever possible.medtronic,lohr,d medtronic,see also cipollone,supra,at.holding that the presumption against preemption reinforces the appropriateness of a narrow reading of the federal statute preemptive effect.
in this case,the california statutes at issue address a subject traditionally regulated by the health and the costs of medical care.see new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d downhour somani cir,medical soc.of state of cuomo cir,brogdon,supra,d at.the regulation of public health and the cost of medical care are virtual paradigms of matters traditionally within the police powers of the state.medical,at.this is true even though california enacted these statutes as part of its implementation of the federal medicaid program.contrary to plaintiff assertion,medicaid is not a field traditionally legislated by congress.rather,by enacting the medicaid statutes,congress legislated in the field of public field traditionally regulated by the states.see ibid.the presumption against preemption therefore applies.rice santa fe elevator,supra,at.
indeed,the very nature of the medicaid program triggers a presumption against preemption.the medicaid program is based on a scheme of cooperative federalism.king smith,d.under this scheme,a participating state creates and administers its own plan which must be approved by the secretary.see elizabeth blackwell center,supra,at.thus,the participating state works in tandem with the federal government in pursuit of a common provision of medical care to the needy.where,as here,coordinate state and federal efforts exist within a complementary administrative framework,and in the pursuit of common purposes,the case for federal becomes a less persuasive one.new york of social services dublino,d.
with these standards in mind,we now consider plaintiff contention that federal medicaid law actually conflicts with and therefore preempts california provider lien statutes.
when determining the preemptive effect of federal law,we are guided by the united states supreme court comment that t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every case.medtronic,supra,at,quoting retail clerks schermerhorn,d.congress intent,of course,primarily is discerned from the language of the statute and the statutory framework surrounding it.medtronic,at,quoting gade national solid wastes management,d.also relevant,however,is the structure and purpose of the statute as a whole,citation as revealed not only in the text,but through the reviewing court reasoned understanding of the way in which congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect business,consumers,and the law.medtronic,at,quoting gade,at.
where,as here,congress enacted the preemption statute pursuant to its spending power,congress must speak with a clear voice pennhurst state school halderman,d.i f congress desires to condition the states receipt of federal funds,it must do so unambiguously enabl ing the states to exercise their choice knowingly,cognizant of the consequences of their participation.south dakota dole,d,quoting pennhurst,at.there can be no knowing acceptance if a state is unaware of the conditions or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.pennhurst,at.thus,in exercising its spending power,congress must unambiguously state that it is imposing an obligation and clearly define the scope of that obligation.in light of this need for congressional clarity and the presumption against preemption,any ambiguity in the medicaid statutes and regulations must be construed against preemption.
we therefore begin by reviewing the history and language of the relevant federal statutes and regulations.see medtronic,supra,at.in creating medicaid,congress sought to provide medical assistance to persons whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary care and services.atkins rivera,d.congress also intended t he program to be the payor of last resort that is,other available third party resources must be used before the medicaid program pays for the care of an individual eligible for medicaid.medicaid program state plan requirements and other provisions relating to state third party liability programs.
at the time congress first enacted medicaid,health care providers often supplemented payments from the state with contributions from the needy patient or his or her relatives.see resident noot.recognizing that any amount charged directly to a medicaid beneficiary for medical services would interfere with the beneficiary access to the medical attention he needs yanez jones,the secretary promulgated code of federal regulations part which eventually became code of federal regulations part see also supplementation of payments made to skilled nursing homes medical assistance,notice of interim policies and requirements.like code of federal regulations part,this regulation forced state plans to require providers to accept the medicaid payment as payment in full and to prohibit providers from recovering from the beneficiary any amount exceeding the medicaid payment see yanez,at sargeant commr.of public welfare,supra,at,fn.
in the nursing home context,however,many states were unable to bear the entire cost of providing medical care to the needy,notwithstanding the states receipt of federal funds.resident noot,supra,at.congress acknowledged that these states depend ed upon the supplementation of the state agency allowances for care with contributions from relatives or the needy individual himself,sess,reprinted in cong.admin.news.but congress concluded that a s a matter of public policy,it would be best for all concerned the needy individual,his relatives,the state agency,and the nursing home if the reimbursement made by the state represented the reasonable cost or reasonable charges for comparable services.ibid.the secretary therefore delayed the implementation of the payment in full requirement for nursing homes but required state plans to phase out their practice of supplementation within a reasonable period of time see johnson professional nursing home weinberger,supra,at see also,supplementation of payments made to skilled nursing homes state plan requirements.
in the and,congress amended the medicaid statutes to permit some charges,such as copayments and deductibles.under these amendments,state plans could charge medicaid beneficiaries certain nominal amounts.see medicaid program imposition of cost sharing charges under medicaid.may.the basic intent of providing states with the option of imposing requirements was to prevent beneficiary of health care services covered under medicaid by imposing a nominal payment obligation on beneficiaries.in,congress enacted united states code section a c to clarify the responsibility of medicaid beneficiaries for copayments and deductibles when third parties are liable for payments on their behalf,sess,reprinted in cong.admin.news.
pursuant to section a c of title of the united states code,the secretary promulgated code of federal regulations part.the intent of this provision was to protect the medicaid beneficiary from being charged for a service in excess of the amounts allowed under the state plan after considering the third party liability.parts and of code of federal regulations therefore had complementary purposes.under,the provider is limited to the amount paid by the agency plus any deductible,coinsurance or copayment required by the plan and is not entitled to collect additional payment from the state.meanwhile,part prohibits the provider from seeking to collect from the medicaid beneficiary any amount that exceeds the amount,if any,allowed as beneficiary liability in the state plan a.
as evidenced by this legislative history,the secretary clearly intended to bar a health care provider from recovering from a medicaid beneficiary any amount exceeding the charges allowed under the state plan.the secretary found it necessary to impose this limitation on provider recovery in order to effectuate congress intent and to ensure medical care for the needy.see yanez jones,supra.at.as noted earlier,the secretary has broad authority to effectuate congress intent in this context,and we must give its regulations legislative effect.schweiker,supra,at.
our review of the language of these federal statutes and regulations limiting provider reimbursement in the context of the surrounding regulatory framework confirms this intent.where,as here,probable liability of a third party can not be established at the time the claim is filed,the state agency must pay the full amount due under its payment schedule.see c.under code of federal regulations part,the provider must accept this payment plus any charges allowed under the plan as payment in full.meanwhile,united states code section a c and code of federal regulations part the corresponding providers from collecting from an individual who is entitled to medical assistance under the state plan with respect to a service for which a third party is liable for payment if the amount of the liabilities of the third parties is equal to or greater than the amount payable under the state plan.a c see also.if the amount of the liabilities of the third party is less than the amount payable under the state plan,then the provider may collect from the individual only the lesser of a ny payment amount a i or a n amount which represents the difference between the amount payable under the state plan and the total of the established third party liability for the services a ii see also a c.
read together,these statutes and regulations are unambiguous and limit provider collections from a medicaid beneficiary to,at most,the charges allowed under the state plan,even when a third party tortfeasor is later found liable for the injuries suffered by that beneficiary.see mallo public health trust of dade county d,mallo a c requires the health care provider to collect from the medicaid patient no more than the amount of the medicaid payment.thus,a health care provider may,at most,recover a nominal amount from the beneficiary.a any deduction,cost sharing,or similar charge imposed under the plan will be nominal in amount.
by contrast,under sections and,a provider,after refunding the payment,may recover the full customary charge for its services through a lien on the beneficiary,his or her recovery for lost wages or pain and suffering.because this customary charge is usually,if not always,greater than the amount payable under medicaid see mcamis wallace,supra.at,these sections allow the provider to recover from the beneficiary an amount greater than the nominal charges allowed under the state plan.because sections and allow the provider to recover more than these charges from the beneficiary,they can not coexist with federal law and stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of congress intent.see english,supra,at.
while federal statutes and regulations do not bar a provider from recovering from liable third parties,we reject defendant contention that there is no collection from the beneficiary for purposes of federal law when a provider collects on a lien pursuant to sections and.a lien is a charge imposed in some mode other than by a transfer in trust upon specific property by which it is made security for the performance of an act,italics added.in this case,a lien filed under section imposes a charge on the entire judgment,compromise,or settlement obtained by the medicaid beneficiary,and the entire award otherwise accruing to the beneficiary may be used to satisfy the lien.thus,a provider recovery on the lien may encompass the portion of the judgment,compromise,or settlement compensating the beneficiary for,among other things,lost wages and pain and not just the portion compensating her for medical expenses as such,sections and necessarily allow the provider to assert an interest in the personal property of the medicaid beneficiary.see martin ex.rel.hoff city of rochester,martin claims which accrue to the medical assistance recipient as a result of the injuries that necessitated the medical care are the personal property of the medical assistance recipient code civ,subds.a,b stating that a cause of action for money or property that is the subject of a pending action or special proceeding is the property of the judgment debtor and may be subject to enforcement of a money judgment.and they do not give the provider the right to collect its fees directly from the third party tortfeasor.recovery on a provider lien filed pursuant to section therefore comes from the not from the third party purposes of federal law.
even assuming federal law is ambiguous on this point,the june,policy clarification letter sent by the acting director of the medicaid bureau of the hcfa to all state medicaid directors confirms that sections and conflict with federal law.where a federal regulation is ambiguous,an agency interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to deference.christensen harris county,d christensen.as the secretary attempt to give interpretive guidance to the states in advance of their submission of state medicaid plans elizabeth blackwell center,supra,at,fn.omitted,this letter is a policy directive entitled to considerable deference see id.at according great deference to a policy directive issued by the director of the medicaid bureau of the hcfa in the letter,the acting director stated that f ederal law would not preclude the practice of providers pursuing payment in tort situations in excess of medicaid reimbursement as long as a state satisfies two conditions.first,the state must assure that medicaid is made whole before the provider recovers any money.second,the state must protect the assets of medicaid beneficiaries by limiting provider recovery to the portion of the award specifically allocated for the beneficiary medical expenses.
although sections and meet the first condition,they do not meet the second.under these statutes,the entire award obtained by the medicaid beneficiary is subject to a lien filed under section the statutes do not limit provider recovery to the portion of the award specifically allocated to medical expenses.as the policy clarification observed,portions of the award unrelated to medical expenses constitute the general assets of the beneficiary for purposes of federal law.even if the beneficiary may request an allocation of the award,as suggested by defendant,nothing in the statutes ensures that the provider recovery will be limited to the portion of the award allocated to medical expenses thus,the provider lien statutes do not satisfy the second condition required by the policy clarification.because the letter clearly states that any scheme permitting provider recovery in excess of medicaid reimbursement without satisfying this condition violates federal law,sections and are preempted 
cases holding that a lien asserted by a state medicaid agency against the entire judgment,compromise or settlement of a medicaid beneficiary does not violate the statutory prohibition against imposing a lien against a beneficiary property are inapposite.cricchio pennisi.these cases hold that the agency lien does not attach to the property of the beneficiary because the beneficiary,by statute,has to assign to the agency any rights he or she has to seek reimbursement from any third party up to the amount of medical assistance paid.cricchio,at.because the injured medicaid beneficiary has assigned its recovery rights to the state agency,and the agency is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary citations,the settlement proceeds are resources of the tortfeasor that are owed to the agency.id.at.the state agency therefore steps in and puts a lien on the recovery before it becomes the property of the medicaid beneficiary.wilson washington,supra,at,italics added.
medicaid beneficiaries do not,however,have to assign to providers their right to recover from third parties.thus,a provider does not have a direct cause of action against a third party tortfeasor and may not independently recover any amount from that tortfeasor.consequently,a lien filed under section does not attach until after the judgment,compromise,or settlement becomes the property of the medicaid beneficiary.recovery of any amount not allocated to medical expenses therefore constitutes a collection from the beneficiary personal property.because the lien allows the provider to recover from the beneficiary an amount exceeding the nominal charges allowed by federal medicaid law,the lien can not coexist with federal law and stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the objectives of medicaid.
while no california courts have addressed the preemption question but see palumbo myers d,fn.acknowledging the lurking preemption question,our finding of preemption comports with decisions reached by other jurisdictions.in public health trust of dade dade.school bd.so d,a florida court of appeal found that federal law preempted a state regulation analogous to section.under this regulation,a provider could recover benefits on behalf of medicaid and after medicaid has been made whole,any excess benefits collected by a provider are permitted to be applied to provider charges that exceed medicaid payment public health trust,at,quoting.admin.code ann,subd.invalidating the regulation,the court concluded that it was in direct conflict with federal m edicaid laws which provide that when a medical provider accepts payment from medicaid,such payment constitutes payment in full.public health trust,at.
using similar reasoning,the seventh circuit court of appeals barred a provider from suing a medicaid beneficiary for the full cost of its services even though the provider was willing to refund the medicaid payment.evanston hospital hauck cir,hauck.in hauck,a provider was paid by the state medicaid agency.after the patient obtained a judgment,the provider sued the medicaid beneficiary and the state agency,seeking a declaration that the provider could refund the medicaid payment and sue the beneficiary for the full cost of its services.citing various state and federal statutes,including united states code section a,the seventh circuit court of appeals concluded that the provider could not recover from the beneficiary once it received payment from medicaid.hauck,at.although hauck did not involve a state statute that expressly authorized provider recovery from a beneficiary,its conclusion is equally applicable here.
a florida federal district court also used this reasoning to hold that a medicaid beneficiary may sue a provider under title united states code section.see mallo,supra,d at.in mallo,a provider sought to recover more than the medicaid payment by asserting a lien for the full costs of its services against any recovery obtained by a medicaid beneficiary.the court found that the patient could sue the provider for asserting this lien because the structure of section a c creates a beneficiary contractual obligation on the part of the health care provider to collect from the medicaid patient no more than the amount of the medicaid payment.id.at,italics added.once a health care provider commits to medicaid assistance for a patient,the provider is barred from billing the patient for an amount in excess of the state medicaid disbursement.id.at.
these cases establish that a provider that treats a medicaid beneficiary may not recover from that beneficiary an amount exceeding the medicaid payment by asserting a lien against the beneficiary entire recovery from a third party tortfeasor.defendant does not cite,and we could not find,any case law to the contrary.in fact,virtually every case addressing the federal medicaid statutes and regulations governing provider reimbursement holds that u nder federal law,medical service providers must accept the medicaid payment as,and may not require that patients pay anything beyond that amount.barney holzer clinic,cir.by finding that federal law preempts sections and and,in doing so,renders defendant lien invalid,we merely join this chorus.
defendant contention that federal law prohibits only balance not the substitute billing authorized by sections and not persuasive.we acknowledge that liens filed pursuant to section are not strictly a form of balance billing because the lien holder must refund the payment before recovering on them.but nothing in the language or history of the federal statutes and regulations restricting provider recovery from medicaid beneficiaries limits their restrictions to balance billing.the mere fact that t hese restrictions are commonly known as the prohibition against balance billing does not mean that these restrictions only prohibit balance billing.palumbo myers,supra,d at.
the secretary approval of california medicaid plan does not dictate a contrary conclusion.even assuming this approval is entitled to great weight and deference rcj medical services,bonta th,d see also garfield medical center belshé th,d,nothing in the record indicates that the secretary approved california provider lien provisions or that california even submitted these provisions to the secretary for approval.thus,the secretary approval of california plan does not mean the secretary approved sections and.see in re washington state of social and health servs.wl absent evidence the state submitted the specific provisions at issue to the secretary,approval of the state plan does not equate to agency ratification of those provisions.indeed,the policy clarification strongly suggests that the secretary would not approve these lien statutes.see ante,d at,at.in any event,the secretary actions are only entitled to deference if they are not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or in conflict with governing law.see rcj medical,at,d.and the secretary interpretation of its own regulations is only controlling if it is neither plainly erroneous n or inconsistent with the regulation.thomas jefferson shalala,d.because sections and conflict with the plain language of governing federal statutes and regulations see ante,d at,at,the secretary approval does not control here.
we also do not find the april,hcfa letter persuasive.in the letter,sharon yee,chief of the program operations branch,division of medicaid,hcfa,answered several questions posed by an attorney.her letter opined that n o federal waiver was required for the implementation of welfare and institutions code sections and and that these sections do not conflict with code of federal regulations part.her conclusions,however,are not persuasive because yee did not consider all the relevant federal statutes and regulations,including united states code section a c and part of code of federal regulations.see christensen,supra,at.i nterpretations contained in formats such as opinion letters are entitled to respect,but only to the extent that those interpretations have the power to persuade.moreover,yee letter predates and conflicts with the policy clarification issued by the acting director of the hcfa.because an agency institutional pronouncements command greater respect than the pronouncements of an administrator,we decline to accord any deference to yee letter.see irving,supra,at.in any event,federal law is not ambiguous and unequivocally prohibits california from authorizing provider recovery on liens against the entire judgment or settlement obtained by a medicaid beneficiary from a third party tortfeasor.see ante,d at,at.we therefore conclude that federal law preempts sections and.see christensen,supra,at.holding that deference to an agency interpretation of its regulations is only appropriate where the regulation is ambiguous.these provider lien statutes are therefore unconstitutional,and the california statute limiting provider recovery from medicaid beneficiaries in accordance with federal medicaid law controls.this statute prohibits providers from attempting to obtain payment for their services directly from medicaid beneficiaries.see,subd.a.because defendant lien against plaintiff constitutes such an attempt,it is invalid,unenforceable,and uncollectible.
but we do so reluctantly.by invalidating liens filed pursuant to section,we give the third party tortfeasor a windfall at the expense of the innocent health care provider.because the provider may no longer assert a lien for the full cost of its services,the medicaid beneficiary may only recover the amount payable under medicaid as his or her medical expenses in an action against a third party tortfeasor.see hanif housing authority d.where the provider has relinquished any claim to additional reimbursement,a medicaid beneficiary may only recover the amount payable under the state medicaid plan as medical expenses in a tort action.as a result,the tortfeasor escapes liability for the full amount of the medical expenses he or she wrongfully caused.such a result not only benefits the party who should be responsible for the medical costs of the beneficiary at the expense of the blameless provider,it also harms society as a whole.because health care providers can not recover the full costs of their services from responsible tortfeasors,they must either charge more to those innocent patients who can pay in order to recoup their losses or stop providing medical care to the needy.in the end,everybody suffers but the third party tortfeasor.we therefore urge the legislature to remedy this anomaly in a manner consistent with federal law.
despite finding that federal law preempts the lien provisions,we must still determine whether the trial court properly sustained defendant demurrer and dismissed plaintiff entire action on other grounds.we conclude it did.
we begin with plaintiff unfair competition claim.in affirming the dismissal of this claim,the court of appeal held that plaintiff ucl claim is barred by safe harbor protection.plaintiff contends there is no safe harbor for defendant practice of filing liens under section if the lien provisions are preempted by federal law.we disagree.
as relevant here,t he ucl defines unfair competition as any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practice lazar hertz th,d see also bus.a business practice is unlawful if it is forbidden by any law people diagnostic laboratory,th,d.a business practice,however,may be unfair or fraudulent in violation of the ucl even if the practice does not violate any law.see,supra,cal th at,d.
in,we considered a ucl claim for not practices and recognized a safe harbor from such claims for acts expressly allowed by the legislature.if the legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie,courts may not override that determination.when specific legislation provides a safe harbor,plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor,supra,cal th at,d.thus,a cts that the legislature has determined to be lawful may not form the basis for an action under the unfair competition law id.at,d.nonetheless,the legislature mere failure to prohibit an activity does not prevent a court from finding it unfair.id at,d.
although plaintiff concedes sections and expressly permitted the liens filed by defendant,she contends these statutes do not provide a safe harbor for defendant conduct because they conflict with federal law.this contention is meritless.
we initially reject plaintiff contention that these statutes do not insulate defendant conduct from a ucl claim because defendant violated federal medicaid law by filing the liens.according to plaintiff,the safe harbor can not protect defendant from ucl claims for unlawful business practices.we,however,need not determine whether the safe harbor applies to unlawful business practices,because plaintiff can not establish that defendant violated federal law private providers of services derive their obligations from state law and through their contractual agreements with the states,not from title xix.stewart bernstein cir,italics added.federal medicaid statutes and regulations do not impose any obligation upon medicaid providers.yanez jones,supra.at see also harding summit medical center cir,wl a c is formulated as a requirement of a state plan it imposes no independent obligation on medical providers.rather,they create a duty which runs to the state alone.yanez,at.it is clear from the legislative history that the medicaid legislation is primarily directed at the role of participating states in providing medical care with the assistance of federal funds.solter health partners of philadelphia d.because federal medicaid law governs not did not and could not violate federal law by filing liens under section.
none of the cases cited by plaintiff hold to the contrary.in hauck,the seventh circuit court of appeals declared that the provider would violate illinois were consistent with the requirements imposed by federal medicaid it sought recovery from a medicaid beneficiary after refunding the medicaid payment.see hauck,supra,at.it did not hold that the provider would violate federal law.likewise,samuel california of health services,merely found that the state medicaid agency misconstrued its own regulation and enjoined the agency from advising health care providers to follow its erroneous construction.it found no violation of federal law by a provider.id.at.finally,the court of appeal in brillantes superior court th,d,only examined a provider obligations under certain california statutes and did not consider or discuss federal medicaid law.
we also reject plaintiff contention that sections and do not provide a safe harbor from her ucl claim because our finding of preemption should apply retroactively.by enacting these statutes,the legislature declared that provider liens were lawful so long as the statutes remained in effect.see,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,retroactive application of a decision disapproving prior authority on which a person may reasonably rely in determining what conduct will subject the person to penalties,denies due process.moss superior court cal th,d.validly enacted statutes such as sections and undoubtedly constitute such authority.just as courts must presume that the legislature intended not to violate the constitution,but to enact a valid statute within the scope of its constitutional powers miller municipal court cal d,californians should be able to presume that statutes enacted by the legislature are constitutional.otherwise,we place our citizens in the untenable position of guessing whether their conduct may subject them to penalty even when the legislature has expressly condoned it.michigan defillippo,d a prudent officer should not have been required to anticipate that a court would later hold the ordinance unconstitutional.we therefore conclude that sections and create a safe harbor protecting defendant from plaintiff claim of unfair business practices.
using similar reasoning,we find that plaintiff can not state an unfair competition claim premised on defendant alleged breach of its provider agreement.assuming that the provider agreements in the record accurately reflect defendant current agreement,they establish that part,division of the welfare and institutions code which includes sections and and supersedes any conflicting provisions in the agreement sections and therefore provide defendant with a safe harbor from unfair competition claims premised on any breach of its provider agreement.accordingly,we find that the trial court properly sustained the demurrer to plaintiff unfair competition claim without leave to amend.
we now turn to plaintiff tort claims.in affirming the dismissal of these claims,the court of appeal held that the litigation privilege shielded defendant from plaintiff tort claims.we agree.
the litigation privilege,as codified in civil code section,subdivision b,shields,among other things,any publication or broadcast made i n any judicial proceeding.the privilege is absolute in nature silberg anderson cal d,and its principal purpose is to afford litigants and witnesses the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions id.at.although the litigation privilege was originally limited to shielding litigants,attorneys and witnesses from liability for defamation citations,it has been interpreted to apply to virtually all torts except malicious prosecution.kimmel goland cal d.
the usual formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that have some connection or logical relation to the action.silberg anderson,supra,cal d at.as a general rule,the privilege applies only to communicative acts and does not privilege tortious courses of conduct.limandri judkins th,d,quoting kupiec american internat.adjustment d,d.we have,however,extended the privilege to any publication that is required citation or permitted citation by law in the course of a judicial proceeding to achieve the objects of the litigation,even though the publication is made outside the courtroom and no function of the court or its officers is invoked.albertson raboff cal d.thus,our courts have extended the protections of the litigation privilege to the recordation of a notice of lis pendens id.at,the publication of an assessment lien wilton mountain wood homeowners,th,d wilton,and the filing of a claim of mechanic lien in conjunction with a judicial proceeding to enforce it frank pisano associates taggart d.pisano.
plaintiff concedes sections and permitted the liens filed by defendant.plaintiff does not dispute that defendant filed the liens to achieve the objects of the litigation or that the liens are connected to litigation filed by plaintiff and other class members.thus,the litigation privilege shields defendant assertion of liens pursuant to sections and from plaintiff claims see albertson raboff,supra,cal d at,wilton,supra,th at,d pisano,supra,d at.
in reaching this conclusion,we reject plaintiff contention that defendant practice of using these statutorily authorized liens to seize funds in violation of federal law is noncommunicative conduct falling outside the litigation privilege.the only tortious acts alleged by plaintiff were defendant assertion of liens pursuant to section.plaintiff did not allege that defendant committed any acts not authorized by sections and.thus,limandri is inapposite.see limandri judkins,supra,th at,d finding that the litigation privilege did not shield the defendant conduct because the isolated act of filing the defendant notice of lien was only one act in the overall course of conduct alleged in the complaint.indeed,the gravamen of plaintiff complaint is a assertion of liens pursuant to sections and by the litigation privilege.see pacific gas electric bear stearns cal d,fn.
we also find that defendant filed the liens as a participant authorized by law notwithstanding plaintiff assertions to the contrary.see silberg anderson,supra,cal d at.although we hold that federal law preempts sections and and invalidates defendant liens,defendant undoubtedly had a legal right to assert the liens prior to our holding here.as explained earlier,we refuse to penalize defendant for following validly enacted statutes.see ante,d at,at.
finally,we believe plaintiff distorts the impact of our application of the litigation privilege in this case.our holding is quite limited.we merely hold that the assertion of liens as authorized by validly enacted california statutes is shielded by the litigation privilege.this limited holding does not pervert the judicial process and place the court in the unfortunate position of shielding,rather than addressing,wrongful conduct.the cases cited by plaintiff are inapposite.neither barquis merchants collection cal d,nor yu signet th,d involved liens filed pursuant to validly enacted statutes or addressed the scope of the litigation privilege.accordingly,we find that the litigation privilege bars plaintiff claims.
disposition 
we reverse the portion of the judgment of the court of appeal adding a declaration that federal law preempts section,but affirm the judgment in all other respects.
i have signed the majority opinion,but i have done so on the understanding that the opinion does not create the overbroad safe harbor to which justice werdegar concurring opinion properly objects.i agree with justice werdegar that a business whose ongoing practices are found unlawful or unfair could not complain,on fairness grounds,of being enjoined from further such violations in the future,even if the business past conduct was based on what seemed to be an enforceable state law.conc.opn.of werdegar,post,d at,at.and i also agree that a grant of monetary relief is not necessarily unfair merely because the defendant business believed in good faith that its practice was lawful.ibid.in my view,the majority opinion need not,and should not,be read as inconsistent with these propositions.
i agree with the majority that california statutes purporting to authorize care providers liens against patients monetary recoveries from third parties welf,are unenforceable because they conflict with federal law,and that plaintiff tort claims for relief based on defendant having filed and asserted such liens are barred by the litigation privilege of civil code section,subdivision b.under our precedents,moreover,that privilege appears applicable to plaintiff cause of action under the unfair competition law bus,et,as well as to her causes of action for fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and trespass to chattels.rubin green cal th,d,ribas clark cal d.
i do not agree,however,with the majority creation of a broad due process safe harbor for actions taken in reliance on therefore laws,ante,d at,at.in communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,this court held a business practice made lawful by statute could not be judged unfair for purposes of the unfair competition law.the shelter thus recognized was statutory and drew protection from valid,enforceable california law.the majority safe harbor,in contrast,is apparently founded on concepts of constitutional due process and draws protection from state laws that,because they conflict with superior federal law,are completely unenforceable.
were this an action seeking to punish defendant for conduct approved by facially valid state law,i might well agree that fundamental fairness,and hence the constitutional guarantees of due process,would bar the action.see moss superior court cal th,d,relating to penalties.but business and professions code section,which sets out the available remedies in a private action under the unfair competition law,provides for neither criminal nor civil penalties and allows no award of damages at all,much less punitive damages.cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,d.a business whose practices are found unlawful or unfair could hardly complain,on fairness grounds,of being enjoined from further such violations,even if the practices were based on what seemed an enforceable state law.even a grant of the monetary relief available under business and professions code section restor ation to any person in interest any money or property acquired by means of such unfair competition is not necessarily unfair merely because the defendant business believed in good faith that its practice was lawful.rather,in general,as between a person who is enriched as the result of his or her violation of the law,and a person intended to be protected by the law who is harmed by its violation,for the violator to retain the benefit would be unjust.cortez purolator air filtration products,supra,at,d,conc.opn.of werdegar.
for these reasons,i concur in the result,but not all the reasoning,of the majority opinion.
