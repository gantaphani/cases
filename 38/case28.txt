bepsy aguasvivas castillo,the owner of a supermarket chain in puerto rico,was convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit food stamp fraud and one count of money laundering.he had engaged in and enlisted his family in an illegal scheme in which the supermarkets he owned and operated provided cash for food stamps beyond puerto rico permissible limits.some fourteen defendants were originally charged.several,including some of aguasvivas castillo family members,pled guilty and testified against him.
all told,the supermarkets illegal receipts from the fraud,conservatively estimated to be over million,were intermingled with over million in food stamp funds.aguasvivas castillo was sentenced to months in prison and ordered to forfeit the amount of million.he appeals only from his sentence,arguing that two sentencing guideline enhancements were erroneously applied,and he challenges the amount of the forfeiture order under the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment.we affirm the district court application of the sentence enhancements as well as its forfeiture order.
the food stamp program is administered by the department of agriculture food and nutrition service.each year,the food and nutrition service assigns a block grant of approximately billion to puerto rico administration for socioeconomic development of families asedf to provide nutrition assistance to low income families.asedf administers puerto rico program of nutrition assistance nap,which awards food stamps to families and individuals on a monthly basis in an amount based on the family number of dependents and overall income.
nap deposits the monthly food stamp amount for each family or individual onto an electronic benefit transfer ebt debit card,which can then be used to purchase food at establishments.food stamp recipients in puerto rico are permitted to withdraw of the amount deposited on their cards as cash for purchases of food at other establishments,but they may not use the remaining to get cash.this restriction was implemented by puerto rico and the department of agriculture to try to reduce instances of fraud and error in puerto rico food stamp program.see food and nutrition,dep t of,implementing supplemental nutrition assistance program in puerto rico a feasibility study hereinafter implementing snap in puerto rico office of mgmt.and budget,detailed information on the nutrition assistance for puerto rico assessment.
not all food retailers in puerto rico are,so one purpose of the cash allowance is to allow participants without ready access to certified retailers a way to purchase food elsewhere.implementing snap in puerto rico.while the program requires that the cash be used only to purchase eligible food items,actual use of the cash is unmonitored.id.
businesses wishing to obtain certification to accept food stamps must file an application and submit various documents including a criminal record certificate,use permits,municipal patents,a treasury department certificate of filed income tax returns for the last five years,and a certificate of incorporation.
when food stamp recipients purchase food at a business that has been certified,the money from their card is automatically transferred to the business account.this electronic transfer is managed by evertec,a subcontractor hired by the government to manage the money transfers and store the account data of food stamp participants and certified businesses.
aguasvivas castillo was the president,owner,and sole shareholder of aguasvivas food market,afmi and aguasvivas borinquen,abi.afmi owned a grocery store located in san juan,puerto rico,and another in canóvanas,puerto rico.abi owned an additional grocery store in san juan,puerto rico.in,aguasvivas castillo applied for for each of the three supermarkets,and received the certifications in september of.from that point until his indictment in,he owned and operated the three stores,at which food stamp participants could use their cards to obtain food and cash.the fraudulent scheme started as soon as the certifications issued and only slowed down after the fraud investigation began and a search warrant was served in.
aguasvivas castillo exercised control over the three stores finances,cash flows,and employment decisions.he also exercised at least some managerial control over store operations and received regular reports from the stores managers as to sales,deposits,and other financial operations in the three stores.
in,a grand jury indicted aguasvivas castillo and thirteen other defendants for conspiracy to commit food stamp fraud count,in violation of b and,and for knowingly conducting and attempting to conduct financial transactions affecting interstate commerce involving the proceeds of unlawful activity count,in violation of a a i and a b i,and.the grand jury indicted all fourteen defendants,including aguasvivas castillo,for committing food stamp fraud it also indicted aguasvivas castillo and four other defendants for money laundering.the indictment also sought an asset forfeiture of million under each substantive count counts and.the jury convicted aguasvivas castillo on all counts.
at trial,the government proved that during the length of the four and a half year conspiracy,food stamp recipients used their cards to obtain cash in excess of the limit at aguasvivas castillo three stores.in exchange for this illegal service,aguasvivas castillo and his profited they collected a commission of approximately of every cashed.their commissions totaled,at a minimum.
aguasvivas castillo waived the right to have the asset forfeiture determinations made by the jury and asked the court to make the final forfeiture determinations.the court held the forfeiture hearing on september.
the government argued that under and,the total forfeitable amount was at least million.under,the court shall order that a person convicted under forfeit to the united states any property,real or personal,involved in such offense,or any property traceable to such property.a.the government argued that aguasvivas castillo should forfeit million under because that was the total sum involved in the fraud.
in fact,the stores received not million in government food stamp funds over the course of the conspiracy,which aguasvivas castillo placed in six different accounts.aguasvivas castillo intermingled and concealed the fraudulent food stamp proceeds within the total sum of million in these accounts,in order to shield the fraud.throughout the conspiracy,aguasvivas castillo regularly withdrew cash from these accounts to operate the food stamp laundering venture.
aguasvivas castillo argued at the forfeiture hearing that because there was no way to quantify the total fraudulent amount,he should not be ordered to forfeit million.he also initially argued that the fraudulent amount was at most.
after permitting the parties to submit additional briefing,the district court entered a preliminary order of forfeiture on october.the court found that the united states had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount of million constituted proceeds traceable to the conspiracy to commit food stamp fraud and money laundering,and therefore was subject to forfeiture.
in his february,sentencing memorandum,aguasvivas castillo objected to this amount and requested a downward sentence departure variance.he argued that the allegedly funds amounted to no more than and that any money laundering was incidental and therefore,de minimis to the scheme.
the january,report psr recommended that aguasvivas castillo convictions on counts and be grouped together pursuant to d since both offenses were based on a common loss amount,and that count be used to determine the calculation under b because it produced the highest offense level.it recommended a base offense level of eight under a,plus a increase under based on the total loss amount a increase under b b,because aguasvivas castillo was convicted of a increase pursuant to b c,because aguasvivas castillo was in the business of laundering money and a increase under a,because aguasvivas castillo was a leader and organizer in a fraud which involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.thus,with a total offense level of,and a criminal history category of i,the psr calculated aguasvivas castillo guidelines range as to months of imprisonment.
aguasvivas castillo filed a supplemental objection to the psr and a motion for reconsideration of the court preliminary order of forfeiture,in which he argued for the first time that the forfeiture violated the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment on grounds of disproportionality.
on march,the court denied both of aguasvivas castillo motions,applied the two recommended enhancements and ordered aguasvivas castillo to forfeit million.
for the sentencing calculation,the court relied on a of the sentencing guidelines,which calculates the base offense level applicable to money laundering crimes,including theft,property destruction,and fraud.the court applied a,which instructs courts to apply a base level of eight plus the number of offense levels from the table in corresponding to the value of the laundered funds where the defendant committed the underlying offense but the offense level for the underlying offense is impossible or impracticable to determine.cmt.a.
the district court found that the offense level for the fraud was impossible or impracticable to determine because an accurate loss amount from the fraud was impossible to calculate it could not be established which of the nap transactions at the three aguasvivas supermarkets property of defendant were for actual food purchases and which did not involve actual food purchases but were recorded as such.
the court thus used the total value of the laundered,fraudulent funds to determine the number of additional levels to add to aguasvivas castillo base offense level of eight.in calculating this amount,the court relied on evidence that aguasvivas castillo stores had conducted food purchase transactions of or more within sixty seconds or less of prior food purchase transactions.crediting the government theory that these transactions could not be legitimate grocery purchases,and that they thus established a minimum loss amount,the court determined that,at a minimum,the fraudulent transactions totaled.the court stated that it was keenly aware that the total amount of money laundered by defendant through his illegal scheme was probably a lot more,given the impossibility to distinguish between the legitimate and illegitimate food purchases and the particular definition of laundered funds applicable to the guideline section at issue.as a result,the court applied eighteen additional levels under b j to the a base offense level of eight,corresponding to the loss amount,to reach an adjusted base offense level of.
the court overruled aguasvivas castillo objections to the two sentence enhancements,finding,with respect to the b c enhancement,that under the totality of the circumstances,aguasvivas castillo was engaged in the business of laundering funds,and further,that with respect to the a enhancement,aguasvivas castillo had exercised a supervisory role over five or more participants in the conspiracy.based on a calculated offense level of and a criminal history category of i,the court determined that the advisory guidelines range for both counts,grouped together pursuant to d,was to months of imprisonment.
later,at the sentencing hearing,the court gave aguasvivas castillo a downward variance,sentencing him to months of imprisonment as to count,and months of imprisonment as to count,with the two sentences to be served concurrently.
the court also ordered aguasvivas castillo to forfeit to the united states the amount of which is the proceeds traceable to the conspiracy to commit food stamps fraud and the money laundered.
aguasvivas castillo,on appeal,raises three arguments.with respect to his sentence,he challenges the district court imposition of the two enhancements,one under a,for aguasvivas castillo status as a leader or organizer in the offense,and the other under b c,for his being in the business of laundering funds.he also challenges the district court million forfeiture order under the eighth amendment excessive fines clause.
sentence enhancements 
we review the district court interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo and any predicate factual findings for clear error.united states pol flores,cir quoting united states bailey,cir.
aguasvivas castillo argues that the court application of a b c sentence enhancement for being in the business of laundering funds should not have been applied to him because he was not in the business of laundering funds on behalf of others thus gaining financially from engaging in such transactions.
the district court held that under t he totality of the circumstances,aguasvivas castillo was clearly engaged in the business of laundering funds.the court considered the six factors listed in the application notes to b c for determining whether a defendant is in the business of laundering funds whether the defendant regularly engaged in laundering funds laundered funds for an extended period of time laundered funds from multiple sources generated a substantial amount of revenue in return for laundering funds had a prior conviction for a money laundering related offense or made statements during the course of an undercover government investigation that he had engaged in any of the conduct listed in factors,or.cmt.b.
for the first time on appeal,aguasvivas castillo argues that in order for b c to apply,the district court was required to determine that he did not commit the underlying offense.see id.cmt.a.because he was convicted of the underlying offense,food stamp fraud,he argues,the enhancement can not be applied to him.this is different from his argument to the district court,which was that b c should not be applied to him because,under the totality of the circumstances,he was not engaged in the business of laundering funds.
aguasvivas castillo new argument is either forfeited or waived since he failed to raise it before the district court.united states falu gonzalez,cir applying this court waiver rule in the sentencing context.however,even assuming he is entitled to plain error review and his failure to present the argument was not a strategic choice,he nonetheless fails to meet the criteria for relief.see united states olano,d.
it is far from clear that there was any error,even had the issue been properly raised.guideline a applies where the defendant committed the underlying offense or would be accountable for the underlying offense as relevant conduct.guideline a applies where the defendant did not commit the underlying offense,or where the defendant did commit the underlying offense,but the offense level for the underlying offense is impossible or impracticable to determine.id.cmt.a.the latter is true here.the defendant committed the underlying offense of fraud,but his offense level was impossible or impracticable to determine.where guideline a applies,a increase may be imposed if the defendant was in the business of laundering funds.id.b c.however,there is some tension between the text of guideline b c and its application notes and legislative history.the text of guideline b c does not limit its application to the first prong of guideline a,where the defendant did not commit the underlying offense.but the application notes to guideline a seem to so limit its application the court shall consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether a defendant who did not commit the underlying offense was in the business of laundering funds,for purposes of subsection b c.cmt.a emphasis added.
the commentary to amendment,which revised and consolidated the money laundering guidelines in,purports to further define what is meant,under subsection b c,by in the business of laundering funds.see app.c,vol.ii,at.it says,t he commission determined that,similar to a professional fence,see b b,defendants who routinely engage in laundering funds on behalf of others,and who gain financially from engaging in such transactions,warrant substantial additional punishment because they encourage the commission of additional criminal conduct.id.
defendant says he was not like a professional fence because his business was selling groceries and not laundering funds for others,and so he should not be punished under b c.
the parties have cited no case law interpreting this guideline,nor is it obvious what the outcome should be where the same business from which the fraud arose is used to launder the funds,and where a number of commit the fraud and assist each other in laundering the fraudulent proceeds into the business larger pool of assets in order to hide the fraud.so even if there was an error,we can not say it was plain under olano,at.
it is also not clear that this issue mattered to the sentence ultimately imposed.the enhancement increased the range from months to months.had this enhancement not been applied,most likely a increase would have been applied under b b,since aguasvivas castillo was convicted under.in any event,the district court gave him a significant downward variance,and sentenced him to months.it found months to be the appropriate sentence under a.
aguasvivas castillo did challenge in the district court the application of the a enhancement for being an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.a the district court found,and we agree,reviewing the district court factual findings for clear error,pol flores,at,that the evidence established aguasvivas castillo supervisory role in the conspiracy.
a defendant acts as a leader where he exercise s some degree or dominance of power in a hierarchy and has authority to ensure other persons will heed commands,and he may be classified as an organizer,though perhaps not as a leader,if he coordinates others so as to facilitate the commission of criminal activity.united states arbour,cir quoting united states tejada beltran,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court correctly considered the commentary to and its list of seven factors in determining whether the defendant exercised a supervisory role in the offense the exercise of authority the nature of the participation in the commission of the offense the recruitment of accomplices the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense the nature and scope of the illegal activity and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.cmt.see also arbour,at.
the evidence clearly established that aguasvivas castillo exercised a supervisory role over the conspiracy regardless of the fact that certain store managers may also have exercised supervisory roles over portions of the conspiracy because they were in charge of the operations of the stores.aguasvivas castillo was the president,owner,and sole shareholder of the two corporations,afmi and abi,which owned the three supermarkets.he certified the supermarkets as and provided the extensive documentation required.although the three stores had their own managers,aguasvivas castillo received regular reports from these managers as to the sales,deposits,and other financial business occurring at the store.in addition,he exercised control over employment decisions including the hiring,firing,and relocations of the stores managers.
significantly,aguasvivas castillo also controlled the finances for the three stores.he was the sole signatory of the stores bank accounts,and exercised control over each account.he received bank statements for the three accounts and prepared the tax returns for the two holding corporations.
aguasvivas castillo well knew about the illegal operations.he was present on a number of occasions when illegal food stamp transactions were being conducted,and he instructed the store managers to conduct the illegal transactions.he provided the stores with cash for the illegal transactions from the stores accounts and set the kickback fee amount.finally,after the execution of the federal search warrant at the stores,aguasvivas castillo provided instructions to the store managers to gradually reduce the number of and eventually stop the illegal transactions.
b.the million forfeiture 
on appeal,aguasvivas castillo makes two arguments that the imposition of a million forfeiture violates the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment,only one of which,an argument as to the disproportionality of the forfeiture,was raised in the district court.
aguasvivas castillo argues,for the first time on appeal,that the million forfeiture is unconstitutional under this court decisions in united states levesque,cir,and united states jose,cir,because,he newly alleges,it will deprive him of his livelihood.we review only for plain error.b a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court attention.olano,at.jose,at see also united states fogg,cir to be published in.to establish plain error,aguasvivas castillo must demonstrate that there was error the error was plain and the error affected the defendant substantial rights.olano,at.where there is plain error,the court must next consider whether the error adversely impacted the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.
in levesque,we held that defendants may raise whether the forfeiture order is so excessive under the eighth amendment that it would,in extreme cases,effectively deprive the defendant of his or her future livelihood.at.this question is separate from the test for gross disproportionality and may require factual findings beyond those previously made by the district court.id.at.
it is the defendant burden,not the government,to raise the issue of future deprivation of livelihood.fogg,at.aguasvivas castillo neither raised the issue in the trial court nor put facts into the record on the topic.a defendant inability to satisfy a forfeiture at the time of conviction,in and of itself,is not at all sufficient to render a forfeiture unconstitutional,nor is it even the correct inquiry.id.quoting levesque,at.even where a defendant does not have sufficient funds to cover the forfeiture at the time of the conviction,the government may seize future assets to satisfy the order.united states hall,cir see also united states katz,wl,at cir,finding no plain error in district court forfeiture order where defendant argued for the first time on appeal,without citing authority,that excessiveness may be established with reference to the financial burden created by the forfeiture order.
as the government notes,the attorney general and secretary of the treasury may remit a forfeiture on the grounds of hardship to the defendant under j,d,and,should a reason to do so exist.see united states ortiz cintrón,cir.
our review of aguasvivas castillo second argument,which he raised in the district court,is de novo with due deference given to any factual findings made by the district court.id.at.aguasvivas castillo argues that the forfeiture amount is disproportional to the gravity of his offense.
a criminal forfeiture is unconstitutional under the excessive fines clause if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant offense.levesque,at quoting united states bajakajian,d original quotation marks omitted.to determine whether a forfeiture is grossly disproportional,courts should consider the following factors whether the defendant falls into the class of persons at whom the criminal statute was principally directed other penalties authorized by the legislature or the sentencing commission and the harm caused by the defendant.united states heldeman,cir citing bajakajian,at.
the first factor is not at issue aguasvivas castillo concedes that the criminal statute is principally directed at offenders like him.as to the second,it is true that his gain from the fraud was conservatively estimated at million.however,aguasvivas castillo was also convicted of money laundering,which explains the higher forfeiture amount.the penalty amount authorized under the money laundering statute,b a,is the value of the property,funds,or monetary instruments involved in the transaction.emphasis added.in other words,the total funds involved in and traceable to the money laundering includes any commingled funds.s
