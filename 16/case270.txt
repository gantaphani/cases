this appeal arises out of a labor dispute over seniority rights between two groups of employees of defendant international shipping agency isa.the two groups consist of three and seven employees respectively and.the ten total employees,all employed as checkers,are members of the unión de empleados de muelles de puerto rico,local union.filed a verified complaint pursuant to of the labor management relations act lmra,alleging that isa and fraudulently procured,in breach of the collective bargaining agreement cba,an arbitration award granting seniority rights to.neither the union nor was a party to the agreement between isa and that presaged the award.as alleged,the union,prior to the award,notified both isa and the arbitrator that the union objected to any resolution of the matter absent its participation as exclusive bargaining representative for all ten member employees.asked the district court to vacate the arbitration award in favor of,order an arbitration hearing at which the union and would be provided a meaningful opportunity to be heard,and render damages against isa.the district court dismissed complaint.according to the court,lacked standing to request a vacatur of the arbitration award and failed to exhaust its contractual remedies under the cba grievance procedure.

complaint alleges as follows in april,isa and the union agreed that,whose members were part of the union,would have seniority rights over.members joined the union in may.in february,the union,at the request of,filed a grievance pursuant to the cba with the puerto rico bureau of conciliation and arbitration bureau challenging the seniority rights of.thereafter demanded that the union allow its seven members to intervene in the arbitration of grievance.the union agreed and informed the bureau and isa in writing that the members would be joined as parties to the grievance because they could be affected by any determination of the grievance and that they had a right to participate in the process.
in march,the union,through its president,sent a letter to isa with a copy to the arbitrator previously selected through the bureau stating the union was not in agreement with any arrangements regarding seniority rights that isa might make with or for that matter.rather,the union expressed its view that there is no arrangement whatsoever until the arbitrator hears both parties and issues his award.on august,a hearing before the arbitrator,at which isa,the union,and were set to appear,was suspended.that same day,the union,again through its president,sent a letter to the arbitrator stating the union did not recognize any agreement isa and may have reached concerning the seniority rights of in relation to those of.the letter further stated that the union 
h ad a hearing today which was suspended since gonzalez vargas attorney and the attorney from the company isa attorney requested that it grievance be heard by record,which was never requested from this union for its approval and we found out through you and i reiterate that this union is totally opposed.
three days prior to the scheduled hearing,isa and allegedly had reached a secret agreement on the seniority issue and submitted their agreement to the arbitrator.under the agreement,isa and agreed to amend the seniority list agreement to allow to move up the list and bump and acquire seniority rights over.the arbitrator issued an award on april,incorporating what complaint refers to as a sham,secret agreement.according to the complaint 
isa and submitted their secret agreement to the bureau under false and fraudulent pretenses.isa intentionally mischaracterized this agreement to suggest the union and isa had reached the agreement.isa knew that the union had not approved the agreement and that the union required a hearing on the seniority grievance,with the presence of and.isa also knew that the union rejected any attempt to settle the seniority issue with.
also averred that isa induced the arbitrator to issue an arbitration award based on a ruse and fraudulent scheme,and the sham,secret agreement.based upon the foregoing allegations,complaint claimed that isa had breached the cba and repudiated the arbitration process.as its prayer for relief,asked the court to vacate the arbitrator award and render a declaratory judgment under that any challenge or dispute relating to the seniority list must be resolved with the presence and participation of and,in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the board of directors of the union.further sought an award of damages including emotional and mental distress injuries suffered,and any wages and compensation losses caused,based on isa breach of the cba the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing incorporated into the cba.
isa initially moved to dismiss complaint on the basis that the latter claim to seniority rights was subject to arbitration under the cba the district court,however,read complaint as one to set aside an arbitration award.relying on section of the federal arbitration act faa,specifically a,which empowers a court upon the application of any party to the arbitration to vacate an award procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means,the court held allegations of fraud on the part of isa sufficient to withstand the motion.
isa subsequently filed a motion to reconsider which the district court construed pursuant to.b as one for relief from judgment based on a manifest error of law.this time,the district court reasoned was not a party to the cba or the arbitration proceeding.rather,isa and the union were the only proper parties thereto.thus,the district court concluded lacked standing to challenge the arbitration award.according to the court,would have standing to challenge the award only if the complaint had alleged isa breached the cba and the union breached its duty of fair representation.the court held that failure to allege wrongdoing on the part of the union sounded the death knell of its challenge to the arbitration award.the district court further concluded the cba required to submit its members breach of contract claim to arbitration because the cba contained a provision requiring the arbitration of grievances involving seniority rights.
we need not address whether the district court in holding that lacked standing to maintain this action properly characterized as a to the arbitration within the meaning of section of the faa.certainly,the named parties to the arbitration as reflected in the challenged award caption were isa and the union this necessarily follows from the fact that isa and the union are the named parties to the cba.as the exclusive bargaining representative of its member employees under the terms of the cba,the union submitted grievance over seniority rights to isa.but action is not one to vacate an arbitration award under section of the faa.rather,asserts a cause of action under section of the lmra for breach of the cba.though somewhat inartfully pled,the remedies seeks for that breach are a declaration of contractual rights,vacatur,and damages.
section provides suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce may be brought in any district court of the united states having jurisdiction of the parties.a.despite section plain reference to contracts between employers and unions,the supreme court in hines anchor motor freight,d,recognized that section contemplates suits by and against individual employees as well as between unions and employers and contrary to earlier indications suits encompass those seeking to vindicate uniquely personal rights of employees such as wages,hours,and overtime pay.hines suggests section is broad enough to encompass action against isa for breach of the cba,viewed as the first step in its effort to vindicate its purported right to seniority status.see tejidos de coamo,int l ladies garment workers union,cir recognizing that a section action may request a declaration of contractual rights pursuant to section int l ass of machinists,cir holding section is not restricted to suits for damages or specific enforcement and will sustain a request for a declaratory judgment.
despite loose reference to the standing label in some court opinions addressing employee claims under section,the overriding issue here is not whether has standing.rather,as we shall see,the issue is whether has alleged circumstances sufficient to sustain a cause of action for breach of the cba against isa under section.undoubtedly has standing because its members have alleged a uniquely personal stake in the outcome of the controversy necessary to sustain federal jurisdiction under section.to establish standing,a plaintiff must present an injury that is concrete,particularized,and actual or imminent fairly traceable to the defendant challenged action and redressable by a favorable ruling.horne flores,d.more particularly,in the context of section 
t he determination whether an individual employee has standing to seek enforcement of a right granted under the cba turns upon the nature of the right at issue,the test being whether the right sought to be enforced is uniquely personal to the individual plaintiff or whether it is instead possessed by the bargaining unit as a whole.
samuel williston richard lord,a treatise on the law of contracts,at ed citing hines.we need not belabor the point the factual allegations of complaint readily establish the uniquely personal injury to its members necessary to sustain article iii standing.
whether the district court may exercise jurisdiction under section and adjudicate claim that isa breached the cba is another matter as preconditions to suing their employers under section for breach of a cba,employees generally must be willing to exhaust the cba grievance procedures and abide by the cba finality provisions.see garcia eidal int,cir.subjecting an employee section suit to such preconditions is essential because t he collective bargaining system of necessity subordinates the interests of an individual employee to the collective interests of all employees in a bargaining unit.vaca sipes,d.when employees recognize a union as their exclusive bargaining representative,the rights of the individual employees so represented diminish.see id.a cba generally provides for the final,binding resolution of labor disputes through grievance procedures in which the union fairly represents the aggrieved employee s.section purpose is to promote the integrity of such an agreement according to its terms.see united paperworkers int l union misco,d.
in nearly every instance,t he refusal of courts to review the merits of an arbitration award is the proper approach to arbitration under the finality provisions of collective bargaining agreements.united steelworkers enter.wheel car,d see umass mem l med,united food commercial workers union,cir recognizing that a procedurally sound arbitration award is nearly impervious to judicial oversight internal quotation marks omitted.restricted judicial oversight of arbitration awards is consistent with congressional recognition that f inal adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties is declared to be the desirable method for settlement of grievance disputes arising over the application or interpretation of an existing cba.d.accordingly,courts have not allowed employees to challenge the underlying merits of arbitration awards by way of section absent circumstances that have impugned the integrity of the arbitration process,for instance,fraud,deceit,or breach of the duty of fair representation or unless the grievance procedure was a sham,substantially inadequate or substantially unavailable.harris chem.leaman tank lines,cir per curiam.
additionally,if employees seek judicial relief against an employer under section before the union has at least attempted to exhaust the cba dispute resolution procedures on their behalf,the employer may raise the defense of failure to exhaust contractual remedies.see vaca,at.this too is an important qualification on an employee right to prosecute a section claim against an employer.hayes new england millwork,cir.but neither is this precondition upon an employee section suit unlimited.f ull exhaustion is not inevitably required by a court before it will exercise jurisdiction under.id.consistent with supreme court precedent,we have recognized three occasions when a court may exercise jurisdiction over an employee section suit against an employer absent complete exhaustion of contractual remedies because circumstances have impugned the integrity of the arbitration process where the union has the sole power to invoke the grievance procedures and the union wrongfully refuses to process or perfunctorily handles the grievance the employer repudiates the grievance procedures or resort to the grievance procedures would be futile.cabarga cruz fundacion educativa ana mendez,cir.absent an allegation of at least one of these three exceptions to section exhaustion requirement,an employee section complaint may not survive an employer motion to dismiss based on the failure to exhaust contractual remedies.
of course,in this case we are concerned principally with the second exception to section exhaustion requirement.claims entitlement to section review because,according to the complaint,isa repudiated the arbitration provisions of the cba when it entered into a sham,secret agreement with,thereby inducing the arbitrator to issue an award favorable to absent the participation of the union or,all in breach of the cba.according to,isa can not now invoke as a defense to suit the very grievance procedures of the cba by which it failed to abide in the first place.we agree that isa alleged conduct is suspect because the claim of a sham transaction,in the sense of being both covert and in bad faith,implies a determination to repudiate the relevant provisions of the contract and thereby avoid arbitration.garcia,at.in vaca,the supreme court recognized an individual employee right to secure judicial review of a section breach of contract claim despite the failure to exhaust contractual remedies where the employer by its conduct repudiated the very procedures necessary to ensure the realization of those remedies 
an obvious situation in which the employee should not be limited to the exclusive remedial procedures established by the contract occurs when the conduct of the employer amounts to a repudiation of those contractual procedures in such a situation and there may of course be others,the employer is estopped by his own conduct to rely on the unexhausted grievance and arbitration procedures as a defense to the employee cause of action.
isa submits it is willing to arbitrate grievance over seniority rights consistent with the terms of the cba,and that means with the union as exclusive bargaining representative.but an employer who by its conduct repudiates a promise to arbitrate a dispute consistent with the terms of the cba has no subsequent right to insist on arbitration.see arthur corbin,corbin on contracts,at.rather,if the employer denies the existence or the scope of its alleged repudiation in a section suit and moves for dismissal of the action based on the failure to exhaust contractual remedies,the issue raised is for the court after appropriate inquiry into the circumstances.see id,at.in drake bakeries,am.bakery confectionery workers int l,d,the court told us i n determining whether one party has so repudiated his promise to arbitrate that the other party is excused,the circumstances of the claimed repudiation are critically important.
we have no quarrel with the supreme court statement in chauffeurs,teamsters helpers local terry,d,referred to by the district court,that due to the finality provisions usually contained in a cba,an employee normally can not bring a action against an employer unless he can show that the union breached its duty of fair representation in its handling of the grievance.emphasis added.as the array of precedents illustrate,chauffeurs speaks to the usual section scenario.in such scenario,the employer is alleged to have breached the cba by taking some adverse action against the employee unrelated to the cba grievance provisions.in that case,the employer misconduct has not impugned the arbitration process.rather,the union alleged mishandling of the employee grievance has impugned the process.these were the circumstances that led the supreme court in vaca to comment prior to chauffeurs that in order to succeed in a breach of contract action against the employer,the employee must prove the union breached its duty of fair representation in processing the grievance.see vaca,at.without proof of the union misconduct,the arbitration process has not been jeopardized and courts,as we have explained,are loathe to interfere in labor relations and review the substantive merits of an employee grievance.
but the court in vaca also recognized a second,much rarer,instance where an employee could maintain a section suit against an employer for breach of a cba,namely where the employer through its conduct repudiates the applicable provisions of the cba.the district court never cited vaca or addressed allegations of repudiation.vaca recognized that circumstances may arise,like those alleged here,where the union has not wrongfully refused to process the employee grievance,and thus the employee has no cause of action against the union for breach of the duty of fair representation.but such circumstances do not in themselves foreclose the employee breach of contract action against the employer under section.see vaca,at.and whether the employer repudiates the cba to avoid arbitration or fraudulently procure an arbitration award ostensibly agreed to by the employer and the union,while bearing upon the remedy sought,has no bearing upon the availability of the employee cause of action against the employer for breach of the cba under section.
this appeal in the end is about the fundamental fairness of the arbitration process.as alleged in complaint,isa is solely responsible for the failure of the arbitration process because it repudiated those very provisions of the cba designed to ensure a fair process.vaca teaches that we should not allow isa to hide behind the very provisions of the cba it has allegedly repudiated.rather,vaca suggests that isa is estopped from utilizing the cba as well as the consequent award to shield itself from answering factual allegations.we therefore hold,based upon the applicable law,that the factual allegations of complaint are sufficient to withstand isa motion to dismiss.given the factual allegations buttressing claim that isa and entered into a sham secret agreement whereby isa breached the cba and repudiated the cba grievance procedures,the issue of whether the integrity of the process has been so impugned as to call into question the validity of the arbitration award remains for judicial resolution 
importantly,we do not read complaint as a direct challenge to the arbitrator substantive determination that is entitled to seniority rights over.the complaint does not request a substantive merits review of the arbitrator final decision,and wisely so,because,as we have seen,that review would be very limited,perhaps even more so in absence.because the agreement between isa and the union is to submit irresolvable grievances over seniority rights to arbitration,a court generally has no business weighing the merits of the grievance,considering whether there is equity in a particular claim,or determining whether there is particular language in the written instrument which will support the claim.united steelworkers am,d.
rather,complaint challenges the process through which the arbitrator reached such decision as contrary to the remedial procedures outlined in the cba.in the complaint,recognizes that the dispute between and over seniority must be resolved with the presence and participation of and,in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the board of directors of the union.to that we add so long as those terms and conditions are consistent with the applicable provisions of the cba.in other words,appears quite willing to permit isa and the union to arbitrate its member employees grievances over seniority rights in a fundamentally fair process,that is,with the participation of both and position accords with the sound view that even where procedural aberrations have tainted an arbitration award,
as a rule the court must not foreclose further proceedings by settling the merits according to its own judgment of the appropriate result,since this step would improperly substitute a judicial determination for the arbitrator decision that the parties bargained for in the agreement.instead,the court should simply vacate the award,thus leaving open the possibility of further proceedings if they are permitted under the terms of the agreement.
if on remand allegations ultimately prove accurate,the district court should fashion a remedy not inconsistent with the foregoing.in that event,any damage determination based upon isa breach of the cba must await resolution of the underlying seniority rights dispute between and.
reversed and remanded.
we are left to ponder why neither nor isa,whose respective theories of the case depend on the terms of the cba,have never entered the cba into the record.on the limited record before us,we accept uncontroverted allegations that the union is the exclusive bargaining representative of its member employees,and isa and the union agreed that disputes over seniority rights were subject to the cba grievance procedures.
that the arbitrator written award in favor of seniority rights is not a part of the record in this case defies explanation.we may,however,under.take judicial notice of the official english translation of that award as it appears of record in unión de empleados de muelles de puerto rico int l shipping agency,wl,isa motion submitting certified translations,filed july docket entry.in that case,the union filed a petition in puerto rico commonwealth court seeking to set aside the arbitration award for the reasons that the arbitrator acted without jurisdiction in the absence of the union consent condoned the improper conduct of isa and and denied both the union and due process of law.see unión de empleados de muelles de puerto rico int l shipping agency,no,petition for review of arbitration award court of first instance,superior part of san juan,filed may.the union petition apparently again is pending in commonwealth court after isa attempt to remove the action to federal district court proved unsuccessful.
the union is not an indispensable party to suit.because isa allegedly acted unilaterally in frustrating the cba grievance procedure,isa possible liability to does not depend upon any wrongdoing on the part of the point on which we subsequently expand in part iv.see garcia eidal int l,cir.in fact,controlling precedent dictates that even if had alleged such wrongdoing by the union,still would have been entitled to sue isa and the union separately.see vaca sipes,d hayes new england millwork,cir.where an employee accuses both the employer and the union of wrongdoing,however,the norm is the hybrid action in which the employee joins both defendants in one suit.see,ayala unión de tronquistas de puerto rico,cir.
mutual promises to arbitrate a dispute are the agreed equivalents of each other.a repudiation by one party of his promise to arbitrate discharges the duty of the other party to perform his reciprocal promise this is true,even though the provision for arbitration is only a part of a larger contract such as a collective bargain between an employer and his employees john murray timothy murray,corbin on contracts,at interim edition.
