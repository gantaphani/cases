enrico ponzo operated as a member of the northeast crime syndicate known as the patriarca family of la cosa nostra lcn.after being charged with multiple criminal offenses,he absconded to arizona and later to idaho,changed his identity,and joined a conspiracy.a jury later convicted him on a bevy of charges,including conspiracy to commit racketeering,conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering,conspiracy to distribute cocaine,extortion,flight from justice,and conspiracy to distribute marijuana.and in this appeal,he complains of an assortment of supposed errors ranging from the prosecution use of the grand jury to the court sentence selection,and almost everything in between but none persuades.before explaining why that is,we briefly state the background facts,reserving additional detail for inclusion in our discussion of the relevant issues.
background 
this case centers on ponzo affiliation with lcn,a crime network with a boss,soldiers,and associates an affiliation that began in the late and ended in the mid,give or take.lcn operated its organized crime network through trafficking drugs,loansharking,extortion,and illegal gambling.ponzo lcn membership formed the basis for the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico conspiracy for which he was convicted.following his activities with lcn,ponzo fled massachusetts with multiple criminal charges pending and established himself in a business in arizona.later,he met his and left arizona and the marijuana business.and he eventually settled down in idaho as a cattle rancher.
we begin with lcn.as a member of lcn,ponzo duties included collecting envelopes that is,using threats and intimidation to extort money from bookies and drug dealers.he also collected debts owed from loan sharking 
in addition to his collecting business,ponzo was also involved in drug dealing.he bought cocaine from a man named john mele and frequently rode with vinny marino gigi portalla during the transactions with mele.in turn,ponzo sold this cocaine on the street.
following the death of raymond patriarca,the lcn boss,in,confusion regarding leadership occurred.in the ensuing years,frank salemme began attempting to take control.consequentially,a chasm occurred in the organization,with two factions fighting for control the salemme faction and an faction.in,salemme,leader of the salemme faction,was shot multiple times at an ihop restaurant but survived.trial testimony revealed that ponzo,along with marino,shot at salemme.the attempt on salemme life and wayward leadership created a powder keg within lcn.
in the summer of,the conflict came to the fore.ponzo and another lcn member,michael romano,got arrested for possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute.ponzo posted bail and was released.about a month later,ponzo and romano were driving to collect an envelope from joseph cirame when their car got a flat tire.ponzo left the car and walked away to make a phone call.at this point,a car pulled up,and someone inside shot and killed romano.trial testimony conflicted as to whether ponzo was the target of the murder however,testimony did show that anthony ciampi and michael romano,also members of the faction,questioned ponzo loyalty and blamed him for romano death.ponzo asserts that a man named david clark intended to kill him but killed romano instead.anyway,about a month after the romano murder,ponzo along with sean cote shot cirame,a member of the salemme faction believed to be responsible for romano death.
meanwhile,in september,the commonwealth of massachusetts charged ponzo with assault with intent to murder in an unrelated case.roughly two months later,in november,ponzo failed to appear in state court on the possession of cocaine charges accordingly,the court issued a warrant for his arrest.ponzo hid from the arrest warrant at the home of his drug supplier,mele.while in hiding,ponzo implored mele to set him up with a business in arizona.obliging the request,mele,after helping ponzo move to arizona,introduced him to the business,where these logisticians packaged the marijuana in arizona and shipped the marijuana to massachusetts.
in arizona,mele taught ponzo how to package the marijuana and introduced him to jesus quintero and steve stoico,members of the marijuana conspiracy.ponzo also began using a false identity at that time jeffrey shaw.through the conspiracy,ponzo and his purchased and shipped between and pounds of marijuana a year to the bay state.
several years after ponzo departed massachusetts,on april,a federal grand jury indicted him and others on charges stemming from their conduct in massachusetts.
in,cara pace began a relationship with ponzo that is,jeffery shaw,as she knew him.and in march,ponzo left arizona with pace and settled down in marsing,idaho,where they had two children.
acting upon a tip,the fbi learned of ponzo location about years after he fled massachusetts.they investigated ponzo for about a month after learning of his whereabouts.and on february,law enforcement arrested him at his idaho home.the authorities confirmed his identity through fingerprint identification.
following his arrest in idaho,a federal grand jury in massachusetts issued a superseding indictment against ponzo,which included charges for his conduct in arizona and two new charges for his activity in massachusetts.after a trial,a jury convicted him of conspiracy to commit racketeering,in violation of d conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering,in violation of a using or carrying a firearm during a crime of violence,in violation of c conspiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute grams or more of cocaine,in violation of and a and b b conspiracy to collect extensions of credit by extortionate means,in violation of a use of extortionate means to collect extensions of credit,in violation of a unlawful flight to avoid prosecution,in violation of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute at least kilograms of marijuana,in violation of and a and b a conspiracy to commit money laundering,in violation of a b i laundering of monetary instruments,in violation of a b and attempting to tamper with a witness,in violation of b.
which brings us to today,with ponzo presenting issues on appeal,though most of these have too.for clarity sake,we address his issues in chronological order starting with his pretrial claims and ending with his sentencing arguments.
discussion 
grand jury 
ponzo claims prosecutors improperly used the grand jury for trial preparation.the district court disagreed.and applying an intermediate level of appellate scrutiny a standard more rigorous than the or standards,but stopping short of plenary or de novo review,united states flemmi,cir.quotation marks omitted we affirm.
the background events are easily summarized.in,after his original indictment in,the government sought a superseding indictment following ponzo arrest.ponzo argued unsuccessfully in the district court that the government subpoenaed annette gestwicki and leonard senibaldi to testify before the subsequent grand jury for the purpose of preparing for trial on an offense for which he was already indicted the attempted murder of cirame.
as for the law,all agree that the government can not use a grand jury principally to prepare pending charges for trial.id.emphasis added.all agree too that when the new indictment charges new crimes,it adequately evinces the propriety of the prosecutor purpose and so undercuts the claim.id.at.and because the superseding indictment here added additional charges,ponzo can not meet his heavy burden of showing grand jury abuse.see id.at.
ii.joinder of charges and severance 
ponzo criticizes the government for improperly joining the arizona marijuana and charges with the massachusetts lcn charges in a single indictment.see fed.crim.a permitting joinder of counts against a single defendant only if the offenses are of the same or similar character,or are based on the same act or transaction,or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.in his mind,the two sets of charges involve different statutes,locations,modes of operation,and for the most part participants.and he blasts the district court for refusing to sever the allegedly incompatible charges.see fed.crim.a authorizing severance i f the joinder of offenses appears to prejudice a defendant.the government sees no error with the court handling of the issues if we find both misjoinder and actual prejudice,we must vacate the judgment of conviction.see united states natanel,cir.citing united states lane.but bearing in mind our standards of review de novo for the joinder issue and abuse of the discretion for the severance issue,see united states meléndez,cir.we see no reason to reverse.
our reasoning is straightforward.even assuming without deciding that misjoinder occurred,the error if any was harmless.united states edgar,cir.taking a similar approach in a similar situation.and that is because as the government notes the joinder here did not result in actual prejudice,defined as the substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.id.at quoting lane,at.the court,after all,told the jury to consider each count separately.and the case for prejudice is especially weak when a court does precisely that.united states taylor,cir.on top of that,the jury actually acquitted ponzo on three counts which showed the jury could discriminat e among the evidence applicable to each count,which helps undercut an claim.see edgar,at.
hold on,says ponzo prejudice there surely was because the arizona marijuana and money laundering evidence would not have been independently admissible at trial of the massachusetts charges,and the massachusetts evidence would not have been independently admissible at trial of the arizona marijuana and money laundering charges.but he fails to explain how or why this is so.and an unexplained assertion like this is not enough to establish prejudicial joinder.id.at quotation marks omitted.well,then,writes ponzo,prejudice there certainly was because he was forced to decide between testifying as to all sets of charges or testifying as to none.to get anywhere,he had to make a convincing showing that he has both important testimony to give concerning one count and strong need to refrain from testifying on the other.see meléndez,at.and he believes he did so,claiming he argued below both that he need ed to testify as to the flight from justice and the massachusetts charges to present his belief that he did not violate the law when he skedaddled from the bay state and that he need ed to avoid testifying as to the money laundering charges,which flowed from the arizona marijuana activity.but what he points to for support is a brief exchange he had with the court where he expressed concern about testifying because he did not want to incriminate himself on federal charges pending against him in idaho an argument different from the one he makes here.so he waived his newly minted claim.see ahern shinseki,cir.stressing that a n appellant can not change horses in,arguing one theory below and a quite different theory on appeal.
the net result of all this is that the district court ruling stands.
iii.statute of limitations 
except as otherwise expressly provided by law,a statute of limitations applies to crimes.see a.alluding to that proviso,ponzo argues that the government did not bring the following charges against him within that period a the arizona marijuana and money laundering charges and b the new charges of conspiracy and use of extortionate means to collect debt added by the superseding indictment.but another statute provides an exception to a,saying that n o statute of limitations shall extend to any person fleeing from justice.id.emphasizing that he fled from state charges,ponzo argues that the natural reading of this exception is that flight from state charges does not toll the statute of limitations for federal charges for different conduct.for support,he relies on a dissenting opinion in a tenth circuit case while conceding that s everal circuits the second,sixth,ninth,and,of course,tenth reject his view yet he still believes that the charges should have been barred by the statute of limitations and dismissed with prejudice.the government disagrees with ponzo,unsurprisingly,noting among other things and without contradiction that his theory that the statute of limitations barred his prosecution on these counts because his flight should not toll the statute for subsequent,unrelated conduct makes its début on appeal.having carefully considered all aspects of the matter,we think ponzo theory does not fly,as we now explain.
before trial ponzo filed with the district court a document titled notice regarding statute of limitations,which stated that he reserve d his right to raise a statute of limitations defense as to the new counts if the evidence as presented at trial shows that the new counts were not timely.he then later moved for judgment of acquittal,arguing that a s to the new counts,the government did not prove that the acts were committed within a limitations period and so j udgment on the new counts should be entered for him.the ramifications for ponzo appeal are clear 
as for the arizona marijuana and money laundering charges,because ponzo failed to argue in the district court that his prosecution on those charges violated a,he can not successfully raise the defense in this court.musacchio united states.a defense,the supreme court tells us,becomes part of a case only if the defendant puts the defense in issue.id.at.if he does not press the defense,then there is no error for an appellate court to correct and certainly no plain error.id.so a district court failure to enforce an unraised limitations defense under a can not be plain error.id.and because ponzo argued below only that the new charges should be dismissed under a,his argument here about the arizona marijuana and money laundering charges is a.see see generally united states ongaga,cir.applying musacchio.
as for the new charges,while ponzo did raise a limitations defense before and during trial,he did not make the argument he makes here to the district court.so we review his claim only for plain error a standard that requires him to show error,plainness,prejudice to him and the threat of a miscarriage of justice.united states jones,cir.quotation marks omitted.but as he himself candidly admits,the circuits to consider the issue whether tolls the limitations period for subsequent,unrelated conduct reject the argument he advances.so we are miles away from a plain error,to put it bluntly see,united states marcano,cir.per curiam united states gravenhorst,app x,cir.per curiam.
iv.suppression of evidence 
next,ponzo faults the district court for denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from his idaho home.we need to cover a lot of ground so much so that we provide a short road map for the readers convenience.part a sketches the background events.part b summarizes the parties arguments.part c mentions the standards of review.and part d explains our take on the issues.
background 
in january,the fbi got a tip that a man calling himself jay shaw who looked an awful lot like ponzo lived at hogg road,marsing,idaho after investigating the matter,the fbi believed it highly likely that the two men were one and the same.on february,federal and state officers apprehended ponzo on his way to see a neighbor.he asked to speak with his attorney,though he did say he had two children and later said they were not home.concerned that the kids were home and would be all alone with him in custody,agents decided to see for themselves whether they were there or not.so they knocked on the front door.no one answered.but they did hear a radio or television,so they peered through the window and saw what appeared to be a rifle later determined to be an air rifle and a security camera.satisfied that no one was in the house,agents left the property.a fingerprint analysis done at the jail confirmed shaw was ponzo.
that very day,agents also talked to some of ponzo neighbors,a bunch of whom had known him as jay shaw and confirmed he lived at the hogg road address.one of them added that ponzo said that he owned guns.the neighbor also remembered that ponzo had brought and used an rifle when they went target shooting about four months earlier,in october.
based on this information,agents sought and received a warrant to search ponzo home for evidence related to his false identities,his income sources while living as fugitive,and his firearm possession.executing the warrant on february one day after his arrest agents found among other things a cache of guns,ammunition,and publications on creating false identifications,as well as an kit.agents also found multiple computers.
agents then sought and obtained a second warrant to search the computers,discs,and flash drives in the house for information relating to among other things ponzo false identities and financial support during his time on the lam.returning to the house on march,they noticed that someone had pulled up the carpet in the master bedroom closet,revealing an empty floor safe that looked like it had been broken into.agents called the person now leasing ponzo home,kelly verceles.returning to hogg road,verceles took the agents to see the safe contents which included over in cash,gold coins worth about,and more fake identification cards and driver licenses with ponzo picture.agents later learned that verceles and a had cut open the safe with an acetylene torch and had stolen the items.
ponzo moved pretrial to suppress some of the evidence seized from his house we say some because he did not move to suppress the evidence produced by verceles.the district court denied his motion without holding an evidentiary hearing,concluding that even if the agents initial intrusion onto his property was unlawful,they had seized the challenged evidence through an independent source untainted by the supposedly illegal encroachment.
parties arguments 
after criticizing the court for deciding the suppression motion without the benefit of any testimony at all,ponzo argues as follows against the court ruling a agents acted illegally when they peered through the window and spotted the air rifle and surveillance camera and excising that unlawfully obtained visual evidence from the february search warrant affidavit means no probable cause supported the february search warrant.b agents noticed the computers during the illegal february search,which,again,flowed from the initial illegal entry onto his property and excising that unlawfully obtained visual evidence from the march search warrant affidavit means no probable cause supported the march search warrant either.also,c the court should have suppressed the evidence verceles produced because he had no actual or apparent authority to consent and because his consent was not voluntary.
the government has a markedly different view from ponzo a the court assumed disputed facts in ponzo favor and decided the motion on purely legal grounds,eliminating any need for an evidentiary hearing.b seeing the air rifle and surveillance camera through the window neither affected law enforcement decision to seek any warrant nor influenced the magistrate decision to issue a warrant plus the remaining portions of the affidavits were sufficient to establish probable cause.and c ponzo waived the argument about the evidence obtained from the floor safe by not raising it below moreover,the argument clearly has no merit because verceles voluntarily gave the items to the agents.
we agree with the government,for reasons we will get to after identifying the applicable standards of review.
standards of review 
we review the district court decision to deny an evidentiary hearing only for abuse of discretion.see,united states francois,cir.and when considering a suppression ruling,we review legal questions de novo and factual findings for clear error.see,united states hinkley,cir.
d.our analysis 
the issue is easily resolved.a defendant has no right to an evidentiary hearing unless he shows that material facts are in doubt or dispute,and that such facts can not reliably be resolved on a paper record most critically,he must show that there are factual disputes which,if resolved in his favor,would entitle him to the requested relief.francois,at quotation marks omitted.ponzo has not satisfied this burden.the district court do forget decided ponzo suppression motion after assuming for argument sake,favorably to ponzo that agents saw the air rifle and surveillance camera during an illegal search.and ponzo points to no facts in dispute that could undercut the court independent source determination.so we find no abuse of discretion here.
moving on,we know that under the doctrine,evidence acquired from a lawful source that is independent of any fourth amendment infraction is admissible the thinking being that the exclusionary rule should not put agents in a worse position than if the constitutional infraction had not happened.see nix williams,see also murray united states,emphasizing that s o long as a later,lawful seizure is genuinely independent of an earlier,tainted one there is no reason why the independent source doctrine should not apply.and when dealing with 
a search warrant premised on an application containing illegally obtained evidence the fruits of that search would be admissible through the independent source doctrine unless the agents decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during the initial illegal search or information obtained during that illegal search was presented to the magistrate and affected his decision to issue the warrant.
united states soto,cir.quoting murray,at.because this is a disjunctive test,a defendant need only win under one of the two prongs.
like the district court,we assume without granting that agents offended ponzo constitutional rights when they went up to his house and peeked through his window.turning to the first question,we,also like the district court,conclude that these agents would have sought a warrant even if they had not seen the air rifle and security camera.we say this because law enforcement had known about ponzo status,had concluded he was living under an assumed name at the hogg road address,and had heard about his having guns.on the second question,we,again like the district court,conclude that the affidavit,shorn of any tainted info,contained ample facts to support probable cause to search ponzo abode.arguing against this conclusion,ponzo claims the neighbor comment that he had gone to a shooting range four months earlier a was fruit of the poisonous tree,b too stale to provide probable cause,and c did not support a finding that he would have firearms at his residence.we reject claim a because agents got the info from an independent interview with the neighbor.we reject claim b because firearms,unlike drugs,are durable goods useful to their owners for long periods of time.united states singer,cir.holding that info about a firearm was not stale see also united states neal,cir.explaining that info that someone is suspected of possessing firearms illegally is not stale,even several months later,because individuals who possess firearms tend to keep them for long periods of time generally united states pierre,cir.stressing that w hen evaluating a claim of staleness,courts do not measure the timeliness of information simply by counting the number of days that have elapsed,adding that a court must instead assess the nature of the information,the nature and characteristics of the suspected criminal activity,and the likely endurance of the information.and we reject claim c because the agent affidavit said are the kinds of evidence typically maintained at a person home that matters because the required nexus between the objects to be seized and the premises searched may be inferred from the type of crime,the nature of the items sought,the extent of an opportunity for concealment and normal inferences as to where a criminal would hide evidence of the suspected crimes.see united states feliz,cir.quotation marks omitted.
having found the february search warrant valid,we also reject ponzo theory that the computers seized during the search in march were the fruit of the poisonous tree.
that brings us to ponzo charge that the district court stumbled by fail ing to address the illegality of the consent search of the floor safe that verceles had broken into.the problem here is that ponzo did not argue in his suppression motion that the court should exclude the evidence verceles had handed over,making the claim untimely.see united states albertelli,cir.and a court can not consider an untimely claim unless the party shows good cause.see fed.crim.c see also united states,cir.ponzo makes no effort to show this.and he also makes no effort to explain why,in the absence of any such showing,he is entitled to review even under the demanding standard.so we treat this aspect of his suppression argument as waived.see united states,cir.
attorney conflict of interest 
ponzo next and perhaps most serious argument is that the district court saddled him with a lawyer,counsel john cunha.as ponzo tells it,cunha operated under two conflicts of interest,thereby violating his sixth amendment right to representation.the first potential conflict comes from cunha prior appellate representation of david clark,the man ponzo alleges tried to kill him.the second potential conflict involves cunha prior representation of robert carrozza,a former codefendant of a government witness bobby luisi in ponzo case.reviewing de novo,see united states,cir,we reject ponzo contentions.
guiding principles 
the sixth amendment guarantees the right to counsel.see,ficco,cir.and caselaw illustrates how this principle works.
for instance,caselaw holds that a lawyer simultaneous representation of multiple codefendants at trial inherently raises a potential conflict of interest.mickens taylor,discussing holloway arkansas.that being so,the supreme court has create d an automatic reversal rule for situations where defense counsel is forced to represent codefendants over his timely objection,unless the trial court has determined there is no conflict.id.discussing holloway,at.simplifying our task,ponzo appellate lawyer told us at oral argument that he is not relying on the rule which means we need say no more about that subject.
turning,then,to situations where the rule does not apply,we see that the high court has required defendants there to show that a conflict of interest actually affected the lawyer performance as opposed to a mere theoretical division of loyalties.id.at,emphasis removed.unlike ineffective assistance claims governed by strickland washington,a case requiring the defendant to show that counsel performance was deficient and that this defective representation prejudiced the case outcome prejudice is presumed if a defendant meets this test.mickens,at see also united states decologero,cir.noting that adverse effect is much easier to show than the actual prejudice required for ineffective assistance of counsel claims.and to show an actual conflict of interest,a defendant must demonstrate that the lawyer could have pursued a plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic and the alternative strategy or tactic was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney other interests or loyalties.united states,cir.quoting united states soldevila lopez,cir.accord united states,cir.see also decologero,at emphasizing that s howing an adverse effect requires more than mere speculation.
please note mickens said that supreme court caselaw does not clearly establish,or indeed even support,applying the standard unblinkingly to situations like ponzo involving successive representation of clients.at.but mickens did not decide whether this standard applied in the context,saying the question remained open.id.at.we too have not said whether the standard applies to cases of successive representation.decologero,at see generally united states,cir.suggesting that an actual conflict may arise in cases because one client may stand to gain through negotiations with prosecutors that will injure another,raising concerns of loyalty or information obtained in the representation of one client may be potentially useful to another,raising concerns of confidentiality,especially if the first client is a possible witness at the second client trial.and because we can decide ponzo appeal without ruling on the standard,we provide him the benefit of the standard and once again reserve the question for another day 
conflict involving david clark 
the back story behind the first alleged conflict of interest is this.originally,ponzo chose attorney david duncan to represent him.but after reaching irreconcilable differences regarding defense strategy,ponzo moved for hybrid representation,so he could act as pro se.the magistrate judge denied this motion,which led to duncan withdrawal as counsel.later,the court appointed cunha to represent ponzo.on the first day of trial,months into his representation,ponzo moved pro se for a new attorney because,years prior,cunha had represented clark,whom ponzo claims tried to kill him but killed his friend romano instead.
according to ponzo,a key incident giving rise to the supposed conflict occurred in september,when romano was shot and killed.trial testimony conflicted as to who shot romano.one account,however,placed clark at the scene,with ponzo as the intended target.the same day that romano was murdered,clark killed a state trooper during a traffic stop.and cunha represented clark on appeal after clark conviction for the trooper murder.later,toward the end of,ponzo fled from massachusetts to arizona.
ponzo brought this alleged conflict to the district court attention on the first day of trial.in response,cunha explained that t here have been allegations sort of floating about,if you will,that clark may have been one of the ones who shot at michael romano,junior.cunha went on to say that he did not see a conflict.the court agreed and denied ponzo pro se motion.
ponzo asks us to reverse and remand for a new trial,arguing that cunha had no interest in painting clark,his former client,as a killer or accusing him of uncharged conduct.noting that tolls the statute of limitations if the accused fle d from justice,ponzo adds that the evidence he asked cunha to introduce would have shown that he fled massachusetts not to avoid prosecution but to save his life and that evidence would have removed his case from reach,meaning some of the charges against him would have been barred by the statute of limitations or so he contends.like the government,we disagree.
admittedly,a lawyer faced with the prospect of accusing a former client of a murder one that occurred the same day as the murder for which the attorney previously defended that client may feel trapped between a rock and hard place.but ponzo contention that he hightailed it to arizona not to duck prosecution but because he feared for his life is hard to reconcile with the fact that instead of leaving massachusetts immediately after the threat to his life,he stayed and tried to kill cirame two weeks later.anyhow,cunha actions are easily explained as a strategic attempt to distance ponzo from lcn presenting the evidence advocated by ponzo would have placed him right in the middle of the conflicts remember,the charges against him included rico charges involving a crime syndicate,and so evidence suggesting participation in the organization would have inculpated him.consistent with supreme court precedent holding that an actual conflict entails a conflict that adversely affects counsel performance,mickens,at,our caselaw says that forgoing an implausible strategy or a strategy that could inculpate the defendant does not constitute an actual conflict.see cody,at bucuvalas united states,cir.guaraldi cunningham,cir.and these decisions throw cold water on ponzo first conflict claim.
conflict involving robert carrozza.
even less need be said about ponzo alleged conflict flowing from cunha prior representation of robert carrozza in an unrelated matter.the conflict arises,ponzo writes,because when cunha represented carrozza,he carrozza was a of bobby luisi a person who testified against ponzo at trial and admitted to trying to kill ponzo.the government brought this potential conflict to the court attention.though he had very little memory of the case,cunha did tell the court that luisi had separate counsel and that no agreement existed.stressing that he never really represented carrozza,cunha added that he withdrew from representing carrozza after another lawyer began negotiating a plea agreement for him.the court concluded that no conflict existed.we agree.ponzo speculates that cunha prior representation could have affected his representation of ponzo.but he offers nothing to back up that speculation.and mere speculation does not suffice to show a sixth amendment infraction.see,at.consequently,ponzo second conflict argument is no more convincing than the first 
vi.sixth amendment right to participate in one defense 
we now address ponzo preserved claim that the district court violated his sixth amendment right to participate in his own defense by not giving him hearing aids costing.what the sixth amendment requires for defendants is apparently a question of first impression in our court.following the parties lead,we look to caselaw involving speaking defendants for guidance,knowing that this sort of inquiry is inherently and thus receives review.see united states carrion,cir.noting that considerations of judicial economy require that the trial court,coming into direct contact with the defendant,be granted wide discretion in determining whether an interpreter is necessary.
relying on cases involving speaking defendants,a sibling circuit has held in a case ponzo relies on that the sixth amendment right to participate in one own trial encompasses the right to reasonable accommodations for impairments to that participation,including hearing impairments.united states crandall,cir.assuming arguendo the applicability of this framework,we think ponzo has not shown a lack of a reasonable accommodation.
according to an audiologist report,ponzo suffers from moderate hearing loss a level of hearing loss that would prevent him from hearing most conversation unless at close range.acting to accommodate this impairment,the district court provided him with a headphones that amplified the sounds in the courtroom and b transcripts.ponzo calls the headphones inadequate because they supposedly prevented him from consult ing with his attorney during the trial,apparently because they made him unable to speak and listen at the same time.but as the government asserts without contradiction,ponzo never claimed below that he could not communicate with counsel by passing notes while wearing the headphones.and he advances no persuasive argument here suggesting that hearing aids costing were the only reasonable accommodation for his condition.ponzo does protest that as a public entity,the district court had to give him the hearing aids under the americans with disabilities act.but he makes no convincing argument that public entity includes the federal courts.generally roman jefferson,app x,cir.concluding that w hile the act requires state courts to make disability accommodations,it does not apply to federal courts citing 
discerning no hint of abused discretion in this situation,we trudge on.
vii.prior testimony of an unavailable witness 
ponzo argues further that the district court violated his rights under the confrontation clause by admitting the testimony of mark hildonen a witness who had testified at ponzo trial but who had died before ponzo trial.because we are dealing with a preserved claim of error,our review is de novo.see united states liriano,cir.but there is simply no error here for us to remedy.
the confrontation clause which gives a criminal defendant the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him,see const.amend.vi bars admission of testimonial hearsay unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for,see crawford washington.but a defendant confrontation rights are subject to certain exceptions,including the exception a doctrine that allows admission of unconfronted testimonial statements where the defendant ha s engaged in wrongful conduct designed to prevent a witness testimony.giles california,see also crawford,at stressing that the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing which we accept extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds united states houlihan,cir.explaining that it suffices to show that the evildoer was motivated in part by a desire to silence the witness the intent to deprive the prosecution of testimony need not be the actor sole motivation.
the rationale underlying this exception that a defendant should not be permitted to benefit from his own wrong,see giles,at supports its application here.had ponzo been at the trial,he could have hildonen.but like a defendant who obtains a witness absence by killing him,by fleeing and remaining on the lam for years,ponzo effectively schemed to silence hildonen testimony against him.and hildonen subsequent unavailability signifies the success of that scheming.so ponzo forfeited his confrontation right.see barker morris,cir.finding that defendant lack of opportunity to a witness was directly attributable to his fugitive status united states dikeocha,cir.noting that if the defendant had not been a fugitive he could have the unavailable witness at his trial.to hold otherwise would allow ponzo to profit from his wrongful conduct and would undermine the integrity of the system which we can not allow.see davis washington.
looking for a way out this predicament,ponzo says that because he fled massachusetts three years before this federal indictment and was living in hiding from his past,we can not simply presume that he was even aware of the indictment,let alone the trial.but because he cites no authority for this argument nor does he give us a convincing explanation of what the law should be,assuming he found no authority,he has waived it.see,muñiz,at see also united states,cir.emphasizing that a party not liv ing up to his obligation to develop a sustained argument out of legal precedents leads to waiver quotations omitted.ponzo also talks down barker,saying it is law.but he does not explain why that matters,particularly since supreme court caselaw makes clear that a defendant confrontation rights remain subject to the exception.see giles,at crawford,at.
viii.testimony of 
ponzo accuses the district court of committing reversible error by admitting a testimony from mark weddleton and paul piano who talked about the marijuana activities in arizona after he supposedly left and b testimony about his doings at ciampi club in,given that he supposedly did not visit the club until.the parties wrangle over the standard of review.believing he preserved these evidentiary arguments,ponzo says review applies.the government,meanwhile,thinks ponzo preserved all claims except for his challenge to weddleton testimony.and the government asks us to apply review to that challenge.firing back,ponzo contends he had a standing objection to statements,which,he adds,preserved the issue for analysis.we need not referee this tussle,however even assuming,favorably to ponzo,that scrutiny applies throughout,his claim of error fails.
we start with ponzo argument that weddleton and piano testimony was inadmissible because he had withdrawn from the arizona conspiracy before they had joined it.statements made during the course of the conspiracy and made in furtherance of the conspiracy are admissible.united states fields,cir.citing united states gypsum,see also fed.evid.d e.ponzo had the burden of establishing his withdrawal.see,united states eppolito,cir.to withdraw from a conspiracy,a person must act affirmatively either to defeat or disavow the purposes of the conspiracy.united states,cir.quotation marks omitted.typically,that requires the accused to come clean with the authorities or communicate with his that he has abandoned the enterprise and its goals.united states juodakis,cir.per curiam.ponzo points to no evidence suggesting he did either.instead,he talks up evidence indicating he had stopped working with certain conspirators.but the m ere cessation of activity in furtherance of the conspiracy does not constitute withdrawal.united states ngige,cir.alteration in original quoting united states ciresi,cir.therefore,ponzo did not establish withdrawal from the conspiracy.
as a fallback,ponzo claims weddleton and piano joined the conspiracy only after he had left.but the evidence shows mele recruited both weddleton and piano to receive marijuana shipments in massachusetts during the time ponzo was shipping marijuana from arizona.so this contention goes nowhere.
taking a slightly different tack,ponzo notes how weddleton testified that david rudolph ponzo previous roommate described ponzo as a smart guy who knew the marijuana business good.as ponzo sees things,that evidence was inadmissible hearsay under rule d e.we think not.having already reasoned that ponzo had not withdrawn from the conspiracy,we need only consider whether the challenged testimony furthered the conspiracy.testimony furthers the conspiracy if it tends to advance the objects of the conspiracy as opposed to thwarting its purpose.united states fogg,cir.quotation marks omitted.judged against this standard,rudolph statements satisfy the in furtherance requirement because they showed ponzo role in the conspiracy or alternatively bolstered his standing within the organization since they characterized him as an experienced marijuana packer.see,united states,cir.noting that the in furtherance requirement can be satisfied among other ways by statements identifying other conspirators,explaining how the conspiracy works,or updating members on the conspiracy doings ciresi,at finding that statements of reassurance further the conspiracy.
that leaves us with ponzo argument that the court erred by admitting evidence about illegal activities at ciampi club in when he allegedly did not go there until.the court did not reversibly err for a simple reason ponzo joined the conspiracy in,and these activities took place during his participation in the conspiracy.also,ponzo does not dispute that the illegal acts,as described in the testimony,furthered the conspiracy so we say no more about that subject.
the bottom line is that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this testimony.
ix.sufficiency of evidence 
ponzo attacks the sufficiency of the evidence on two of the nine racketeering acts underlying his rico conspiracy conviction the attempted murder of cirame and the assault with the attempt to murder cirame.ponzo also questions the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the finding that he had conspired to distribute grams or more of cocaine.because he preserved neither challenge,our review is limited to preventing a clear and gross injustice a stringent standard,which we have described as a particularly exacting variant of plain error review.united states foley,cir.as per usual,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,taking all reasonable inferences in its favor.see,united states,cir.but there is not so much as a whiff of a clear and gross injustice here,though ponzo would still be out of luck even under traditional plain error.see foley,at.
a.the cirame shooting 
the jury found that ponzo had committed nine predicate acts well beyond the two predicate acts necessary for a rico violation.see specifying that a pattern of racketeering activity requires only two predicate acts committed within years of each other see also united states marino,cir.he,again,only challenges the jury findings on the two having to do with the cirame shooting to be precise,he is contesting the legal rather than the factual sufficiency of the government proof,given he questions the lawfulness of certain rulings admitting certain evidence.but because he does not show any defects with the other seven predicate acts,his first sufficiency claim is a nonstarter.see generally united states dhinsa,cir.noting that the jury findings of two predicate acts,lawfully constituting a rico pattern,and of the other elements of a rico offense,will permit affirmance of a rico conviction notwithstanding the invalidation of other predicate acts,and further noting that the defective predicate did not dominate this prosecution,eclipsing all else internal quotations omitted united states paccione,cir.finding that a deficiency with one predicate act did not require reversal of the rico convictions because the remaining eight predicate acts suffer ed no defects 
b.the cocaine conspiracy 
a count in the superseding indictment charged that from in or before through in or after october,ponzo conspired with others known and unknown to the grand jury to possess with intent to distribute,and to distribute,grams or more of cocaine.and the evidence at trial viewed from a vantage point showed the following mele regularly sold quantities grams of cocaine to marino in the mid to late.and ponzo helped marino deliver the cocaine.mele also sold ponzo eight balls ounce,or about grams each.ponzo was still distributing cocaine with marino in the early to,delivering cocaine to one of marino customers a couple of times a week.around this time,ponzo hooked up with romano a distributor buying up to six ounces grams per transaction from a supplier as evidenced by ponzo presence at a meeting where the participants discussed the business and divvyed up distribution shifts.the government need have proved only that it was reasonably foreseeable by ponzo that conspiracy members would handle over grams of cocaine.see united states sepulveda,cir.emphasizing that a defendant is responsible for drugs he personally handled or anticipated handling,and,under the relevant conduct rubric,for drugs involved in additional acts that were reasonably foreseeable by him and were committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.with all of this in mind,we conclude that the evidence sufficiently connected ponzo to the cocaine conspiracy that involved grams or more of cocaine at the very least,the evidence is not so insufficient as to cause a clear and gross injustice.
waiver of right to testify 
before waiving his right to testify,ponzo asked the district court two questions first,could the prosecution him on charges pending against him in idaho and second,could the prosecution use his prior convictions to him saying i not in a position to advise you,the court directed ponzo to discuss the matter with his attorney which ponzo did before waiving his right to testify.noting that he had a constitutional right to testify,ponzo argues for the first time on appeal that his waiver was not knowing and voluntary because the court did not answer his questions.our review is for plain error.and we find none.
we begin with the obvious the defendant lawyer,rather than the trial judge,bears the primary responsibility of informing and advising the defendant of this right,including its strategic ramifications,united states,cir.hence a trial judge is not required to apprise a defendant of his right to testify or inquire whether he has waived it,owens united states,cir.and ponzo offers no convincing argument for how the court plainly erred given and owens.critically too,ponzo cites no controlling authority showing that the court had to answer his questions which is not the way to go about showing plain error.see united states morosco,cir.explaining that plain error is an indisputable error by the judge,given controlling precedent quotation marks omitted.
xi.prosecution conduct 
ponzo next maintains that three instances of prosecutorial misconduct require a new trial.because he did not preserve the points below,he is stuck with having to show plain error something he has not done.
examination of ponzo former attorney 
first up is ponzo claim that the government improperly questioned his former attorney,james costello,about the arizona marijuana conspiracy.this is what you need to know.
costello had represented ponzo in on the state cocaine and assault charges.the government called costello to establish that ponzo had failed to appear in state court in november,causing that court to issue a warrant.costello moved to quash the subpoena,saying that w ithout a waiver from ponzo,he is duty bound to assert the privilege to the questions he anticipates the government will ask.the district court ruled that costello could testify about ponzo failure to appear in state court in but could not testify about anything else,believing that that would infringe upon the privilege.
at trial,after costello testified that he had been suspended from the practice of law from to,the government asked him if he knew piano.costello replied,i believe i do,yes,sir.i do know him,but he an acquaintance.the government then asked costello whether piano had pick ed up any packages from you.ponzo lawyer objected before costello could answer.what time frame are we talking about the court asked.in approximately or,the government lawyer responded.and after a sidebar conference to discuss the matter,the government decided to ask costello no further questions.
despite ponzo arguments,we have some doubts whether the government queries violated the district court ruling on the motion to quash,since we question whether the questions touched on privileged communications.but putting that aside,we fail to see how either question prejudiced ponzo.ponzo spends no time explaining how he suffered prejudice.and although the second question may have suggested that costello was somehow involved in marijuana trafficking,the query went unanswered,plus the court told the jury that lawyers questions are not evidence.see united states innamorati,cir.finding no prejudice where witness did not answer the challenged question and the court instructed the jury that lawyers statements are not evidence see also united states robinson,cir.noting that demonstrating prejudice is more difficult when questions go unanswered.so we can not say that the errors rise to the level of plain error.
characterizations of the evidence 
second up is ponzo claim that the government mischaracterized evidence during closing arguments.it is a truism that prosecutors can not refer to facts not in evidence.see,united states auch,cir.but they can ask jurors to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence.united states meadows,cir.and after carefully reviewing ponzo claims,we can say that none warrants reversal because the prosecutor confined his comments to evidence in the record and to reasonable inferences from that evidence.two examples suffice to illustrate the point.the government mentioned that quintero had said that ponzo had shot a or an ak rifle in his free time in arizona a statement that ponzo claims implies that he had a hand in shooting salemme.but quintero did testify that he and ponzo shot rifles,though he could not specifically recall whether it was a.and the government made no reference to the salemme shooting in this context.the government also said that killing salemme was marino and ponzo ticket to getting made.but mele did testify that marino would become a made guy if salemme died.and the government statement that ponzo would get made too was premised on a fair inference from this evidence.the long and the short of it is that nothing ponzo complains about here amounts to plain error.
third up is ponzo claim that the government use of the word we,we know,we learned during closing argument constituted improper vouching which occurs when the government place s the prestige of the united states behind a witness by making personal assurances about the credibility of a witness or implies that the jury should credit the government evidence simply because the government can be trusted.robinson,at quotation marks omitted alteration in original.w hen a defendant fails to object at trial we are not inclined to find improper meaning in a prosecutor statement if there is a plausible alternative.united states rodriguez,cir.the plausible alternative here and the one the record supports is that the prosecutor used we to rehash the evidence heard at trial,not to throw the weight of the prosecutor office behind the evidence to establish credibility.also undermining ponzo argument is the fact that he cites no controlling authority finding prosecutorial misconduct under similar circumstances which means he has not shown plain error.see,morosco,at.
xii.verdict form 
we now address ponzo argument that the verdict form allowed the jury to convict him on the c firearm count for merely possessing a firearm in relation to a crime of violence,as opposed to using or carrying the firearm.because he did not object to the verdict form before the jury retired to deliberate,we review only for plain error.see united states edelkind,cir.and we see nothing of the sort here.
the current version of c covers any person who,during and in relation to any crime of violence,uses or carries a firearm,or who,in furtherance of any such crime,possesses a firearm.see c a emphasis added.but,both sides tell us,the version in effect at the time of the offense alleged in the c count here covered only the use or carry of a firearm,not possession.unfortunately,the verdict form wrongly captioned the c firearm count as firearm possession in relation to murder conspiracy wrongly,because again the offense charged required using or carrying a firearm,not mere possession.studying the verdict form as a whole,however,in conjunction with the jury charge,as we must,united states rodríguez,cir.quotation marks omitted,we see that the court correctly instructed the jury,stating that the government must prove the defendant knowingly used or carried a firearm and then the court went on to define use and carry.we of course presume that jurors obey a court instructions.see,united states gemma,cir.and based on the correct,instruction and the presumption that jurors follow instructions,we can not find that the error affected ponzo substantial rights because we can not say that it likely affected the jury verdict.so the error does not qualify as plain error.see,rodríguez,at finding that a form that mischaracterized the burden of proof did not affect a defendant substantial rights where the court properly instructed the jury and the defendant advanced nothing to suggest prejudice.
undaunted,ponzo argues that the jury answers to the c count questions suggests that it did not find that he had used a firearm.these questions covered certain weapons like machine guns and shot guns that the government says without contradiction would have increased the sentence under the relevant version of c.ponzo cites no authority holding that leaving this section blank shows that the jury convicted him for less than using or carrying a gun.thus,we stand by our conclusion.see morosco,at.
xiii.conviction under c 
ponzo argues in a supplemental brief that we should toss out his c firearm conviction.his reasoning runs something like this 
the jury convicted him of using or carrying a firearm during a crime of violence.see c a.
a crime of violence is an offense that a has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person,or b that by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person may be used in the course of committing the offense.id.c.subsection a is known as the force clause.and subsection b is known as the risk of force clause or the residual clause.
the c firearm count listed conspiracy to commit murder under state law as the predicate for the c violation.
but,to his way of thinking,a conspiracy to quote his brief is an agreement to do something and does not have as an element the use,attempted use or threatened use of physical force.plus,he adds,c clause is similar to the armed career criminal act residual clause,which the supreme court struck as unconstitutionally vague in johnson united states.and,he points out,c clause is identical to a clause in b,which some circuits have held to be unconstitutional under johnson.
ergo and to quote again from his brief he can not be guilty of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence because the underlying crime was not a crime of violence.
because ponzo did not raise this argument below,we again review for plain error only.and we again find no plain error exists.
we jump to c clause,because that is the simplest way to deal with this issue.see generally,strathmore ins,cir.noting that t he simplest way to decide a case is often the best quoting chambers bowersox,cir.the question presented whether c clause is invalid under johnson reasoning is an open one in our circuit.true,the seventh circuit held c clause unconstitutional given johnson logic.united states cardena,cir.but the second,sixth,and the eighth circuits reached the opposite result.see,united states hill,cir.united states taylor,cir.united states prickett,cir.true too,the third,sixth,seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits said johnson nullifies b clause a clause worded identically to c clause,as ponzo notes.see baptiste attorney,cir.shuti lynch,cir.united states,cir.dimaya lynch,cir,cert.granted,oral argument,golicov lynch,cir.but the fifth circuit,sitting en banc,rejected that view.see united states,cir.en banc see also hill,at noting that while some circuits used johnson to nix b,these decisions are unpersuasive and so did not change the court view that c clause is not unconstitutionally vague taylor,at same.and given the conflicting precedents on the question at hand,any error here if error there was was not plain.see,united states pabon,cir,cert.denied,united states goodhue,cir.
perhaps it is possible for there to be plain error in a case where many other circuits make the same mistake,so long as it is clear that they are clearly wrong.but ponzo attempts no argument along these lines,even though he bears the burden of showing plain error.see,united states,cir.so we say no more about that point.
xiv.sentencing calculations 
turning to sentencing,ponzo makes three broad claims that the court violated the constitution ex post facto clause by using the version of the federal sentencing guidelines that the court miscalculated his criminal history and that the court wrongly labeled him a career offender.ponzo preserved the ex post facto issue so our review is de novo.see united states goergen,cir.he preserved some but not all of his arguments preserved issues involve different standards,clear error for factual findings and de novo for questions of law,see united states maldonado,cir.an unpreserved contention receives review,naturally.and he preserved the issue so our review is de novo.see united states velázquez,cir.when all is said and done,though,we leave his sentence intact.
ex post facto 
sentencing a defendant convicted of multiple counts is no picnic.the guidelines tell courts to group the counts that involv e substantially the same harm,and then do,not,sentencing calculations.united states bivens,cir.citing.at the risk of oversimplification,here is how that ordinarily works the court computes the offense level for each count within each group,attributes to each group the highest offense level of any count within it after factoring in certain adjustments for those counts,compares the groups to ascertain which has the highest offense level,considers certain further adjustments,and sentences the defendant based on that triage.see united states florence,cir.see also cmt.
at sentencing,ponzo appearing pro se with his trial attorney as standby counsel argued that to avoid an ex post facto problem,the court should not use the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing but should instead use those in vogue when the crimes were committed.see generally united states mehanna,cir.emphasizing the general rule that absent ex post facto problems,a sentencer should use the version of the guidelines in effect at the time of the disposition hearing.the court thought ponzo had a point but said it need not decide that question because applying the earlier versions of the guidelines to certain count groups would produce the same guideline range of months to life as would result from applying the current guidelines though the court,having concluded that it made no difference which guidelines applied,stated it was applying the newer guidelines,the version.so the court grouped the convictions into eight groups and then used the older guidelines to do the calculations.skipping over details not relevant here,the court concluded that group comprised of the racketeering conspiracy,the drug conspiracies,and the counts had the highest adjusted offense level.and after applying what is called a multiple count adjustment,the court pegged ponzo total offense level at which,when paired with a criminal history category of v or vi the court said it did not matter which,yielded a guidelines range of months to life.the court ultimately gave him months,a sentence that included the months the court had to impose for his c conviction 
ponzo basically rehashes the ex post facto argument he made below,telling us that the court use of the newer guidelines infracted his constitutional rights.but we see no violation because,as the district court showed,the guidelines range was the same under both the older and newer versions.ever persistent,ponzo faults the court for applying a enhancement for group.the court agreed that this enhancement was not around when the relevant crimes occurred and,therefore,would not be applied.but the court added it could apply a enhancement under the older guidelines based on ponzo role as a manager or supervisor in the marijuana conspiracy an increase that would help keep the guidelines range the same under either the older or newer versions of the manual.ponzo briefly argues against that enhancement,saying the evidence below showed that steven stoico was the boss to hear ponzo tell it,he ponzo simply shipped the marijuana.but even if stoico was the boss,making him eligible for a enhancement for being a leader,ponzo could still get a manager or supervisor enhancement.see a,b.and the evidence supported the enhancement because ponzo trained and paid a guy for packing marijuana.see united states,cir.holding that the aggravating role adjustment found in b requires the sentencer to find,first,that the underlying criminal activity involved more than five participants or was otherwise extensive,and,second,that the defendant managed or supervised one or more of the other participants in that activity.
no reversible error happened here.
criminal history 
ponzo says the court erred by assessing points under the guidelines for convictions listed in paragraphs of the probation service presentence report like the parties,we will use these paragraph numbers to refer to the targeted convictions.first he argues as he did in the district court that two convictions found in and should not have been counted because they were not supported by official court records.reviewing this matter de novo,we reject his claim.the conviction in was based on official court records,despite what ponzo says.as for the conviction in,the probation officer noted she had not yet received official court documentation.when a defendant contests a presentence report description of an alleged prior conviction,the government must show that the description in the report is based on a sufficiently reliable source.united states brown,cir.quotations omitted.and where the presentence report cites solely records,the court must conduct additional inquiry into the reliability of these sources.united states bryant,cir.the government here attached police records to its sentencing memo that corroborated the information in which,as the government notes without being contradicted by ponzo established the information reliability.
leaving no stone unturned,ponzo claims he should have gotten no points for the conviction in since probation could not verify whether he had legal counsel in that case an unpreserved contention limited to review.because the government establish ed the conviction existence,the burden shift ed to him to show that the earlier conviction was constitutionally infirm or otherwise inappropriate for consideration.see united states barbour,cir.ponzo does not try to make either showing,however.and even if we accept arguendo that he was uncounseled,he has not shown that he did not waive his right to counsel.see id.thus once again he comes up short on the front.
as a final effort to chip away some points,ponzo says as he did below that the convictions in took place after the commencement of the instant offense and so are not prior convictions for purposes of computing criminal history.approaching this issue de novo,we see that the guidelines say a sentence imposed after the defendant commencement of the instant offense,but prior to sentencing on the instant offense,is a prior sentence if it was for conduct other than conduct that was part of the instant offense.cmt.emphasis added.conduct that is part of the instant offense,the guidelines add,means conduct that is relevant conduct to the instant offense,id,conduct that is within the scope of and in furtherance of the criminal activity and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity,see a b.ponzo began his participation in the racketeering conspiracy before he was sentenced on the offenses in.but critically for our purposes,at the time of sentencing in this case,he had already been sentenced for the offenses in.and nothing leads us to believe nor does ponzo persuasively argue that these convictions constituted relevant conduct to this case.
no reversible error occurred here.
designation 
ponzo believes the district court wrongly classified him as a career offender under.but we need not delve into that issue.and that is because as the government says,and as the court itself noted the designation made no difference to his guidelines range even without it,ponzo still faced a guidelines range of months to life.and that makes any error if there was one harmless see united states battle,cir.
we have no reason to reverse here,either.
xv.forfeiture 
the district court ordered ponzo to forfeit million.and ponzo assigns five errors with that award.the government sees no problems,we should add.for properly preserved claims,we review pure questions of law de novo,but,to the extent factual issues are intermingled,consider mixed questions of law and fact under the more deferential clear error standard.see united states,cir.see also united states jose,cir.explaining that when a defendant claims a forfeiture is constitutionally excessive,o ur review is de novo,with deference given to the district court factual findings under the standard.we review unpreserved issues for plain error.see,jose,at.readers should consider an issue preserved either because it is preserved or because it is easier for us to assume it is preserved,unless told otherwise.
ponzo opens up by claiming without citation to any authority that the judge should have limited the forfeiture to the amount sought in the superseding indictment an unpreserved claim of error.the superseding indictment told ponzo that the government sought the proceeds of the crime,including but not limited to a million judgment.rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides that the forfeiture notice in an indictment need not specify the amount of any forfeiture money judgment that the government seeks,see fed.crim.a it logically follows that a forfeiture determination need not flow from the indictment,or so says the government.putting aside this theory,we think what dooms ponzo claim is that he has not shown that this alleged error was plain under controlling precedent which means this challenge flunks review.see,morosco,at.
ponzo next claims the court erred by determining the forfeiture amount instead of the jury.but that argument has no traction either.the criminal rules provide that either party may request that the jury be retained to determine the forfeitability of specific property.fed.crim.b a.but the rules say nothing about the jury determining the forfeiture amount.instead the rules declare that i f the government seeks a personal money judgment,the court must determine the amount of money that the defendant will be ordered to pay.fed.crim.b a emphasis added generally united states,cir.reviewing a forfeiture amount.and today we follow our sibling circuits in holding that the criminal rules do not require a jury determination in the form of a personal money judgment.united states christensen,cir.see also united states jameel,app x,cir.per curiam united states curbelo,cir.united states grose,app x,cir.united states gregoire,cir.
shifting gears,ponzo also claims the court botched matters by not limiting t he money judgment to the amount that he actually received for his role in shipping the marijuana,or at most the profits from the conspiracy.his suggestion that the forfeiture amount should not include funds received by his runs headlong into caselaw establishing that s o long as the amount handled by others is foreseeable as to a defendant,the foreseeable amount represents the sounder measure of liability.see united states hurley,cir.
next,quoting a which says i n lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by this part,a defendant who derives profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds and which he agrees he was subject to ponzo claims other proceeds means net profits,not gross proceeds.but we rejected that very argument in united states bucci,which held that a district court did not plainly err by instructing a jury that proceeds in a means the gross proceeds of drug trafficking,not net profits.see,cir.true,bucci analyzed the issue in terms of plain error.id.but bucci made clear that there was no error at all.see id.
pulling out all the stops,ponzo claims the money judgment violated the eighth amendment clause because in his view it will deprive him of the ability to make a living.see united states,cir.a ssuming,without deciding,that deprivation of livelihood can constitute a basis for setting aside a criminal forfeiture judgment united states,cir.holding that a defendant may raise whether the forfeiture order is so excessive under the eighth amendment that it would,in extreme cases,effectively deprive the defendant of his or her future livelihood.but as the government points out,the attorney general and the secretary of the treasury may remit a forfeiture on the grounds of hardship to ponzo under j,d,and,if appropriate.see,at.and as the district court pointed out,the value of the specific assets found forfeitable will reduce the money judgment so ponzo will not be required to earn and the full million.the end result is that ponzo has not met his burden to establish a record at the district court level that could sustain a deprivation of livelihood claim.see,at.
ponzo also takes the district court to task for issuing a september,restraining order on his prison commissary account without a hearing he says that e required the court to hold a hearing since he asked for one this even though e applies only to temporary restraining orders issued when an information or indictment has not yet been filed and the restraining order here came after the indictment.but we need not deal with his argument because as the government is quick to note his pro se notice of appeal from the court order is untimely.ponzo dated the notice october,exactly days after the district court entered the order.see generally fed.app.b a i giving a criminal defendant days to file a notice of appeal.but the notice was not docketed until october,days after the due date.see generally united states,cir.explaining that w e need to decide whether rule b time limits are jurisdictional because the time limits,even if not jurisdictional,are mandatory when raised by the government.and ponzo represented by counsel on appeal does nothing to establish the timeliness of his notice under the rule.see fed.app.c.enough said about the issue.
conclusion 
here is what this all means we dismiss the appeal from the restraining order as untimely and affirm the judgments in the other appeals,and.
because ponzo challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the government.see united states munyenyezi,cir.
for example,one time ponzo entered a restaurant,demanded repayment of a loan owed to a loan shark,and threatened to kill the owner if he did not repay the money.a month after this conversation,the owner sold his restaurant and paid ponzo the.
the parties agree that ponzo preserved these issues for our consideration.
