this citizen enforcement action under the federal water pollution control act,et clean water act or cwa,is the third such suit brought by louis paolino and his wife marie issa collectively against the owner of a neighboring parcel of land and the business operating on it,it is only the latest in an inventive series of unjustifiable efforts to indict their neighbor environmental practices.we affirm the district court judgment for and award of attorneys fees to the same.
i.the facts 
in,joseph ferreira bought a site the property in cumberland,rhode island.the property is currently owned by jf realty,llc,jf realty of which ferreira is the sole member,and is home to an automobile recycling business lkq route used auto parts,advanced auto recycling lkq.in december,paolino bought a property the property abutting the property for.the two properties were previously part of a larger parcel operated at various points as a pig farm and waste dump.
in the early,paolino sold two parcels for development.the purchaser subsequently sued paolino for failing to disclose that the property was contaminated.paolino then sought a tax abatement in because of the contamination found on his property.paolino was directed to remediate his property,but has not completed that process.
in march,also as a result of the contamination pervading both properties,the rhode island department of environmental management ridem issued a notice of intent to enforce nie to the of the property,advanced auto recycling advanced auto,requiring it to install controls to prevent stormwater runoff on the property and apply for a rhode island pollution discharge elimination system ripdes permit for the property.ferreira business manager,robert yabroudy,subsequently submitted an application to ridem for the permits required by the nie,naming the operator as advanced auto and the owner as the joseph ferreira trust ferreira trust although it appears that at that point in time the property was owned by jf realty and operated by lkq ridem would go on to issue the ripdes permit to the joseph ferreira trust in july.
the stormwater management system that was installed on the property would ultimately consist of two outfall pipes to drain various of the property surface areas,with large detention basins underneath to collect water and trap contaminants,set in the headwall facing curran road.the pipes drain into an outfall channel that eventually leads to curran brook.construction of the system began in october.during the construction lkq received a second nie on april.defendants contracted a civil engineering firm,commonwealth engineers,to bring the property into compliance and ultimately completed the construction in october.
ridem investigated numerous of repeated complaints and notified them that they found all but one without merit.were notified in april that the discharge point for stormwater had been relocated and was not discharging stormwater onto their property.
on march,ridem issued a notice of violation nov to jf realty informing them that an inspection on november,showed that pollutants were being discharged from the property to curran brook in violation of the rhode island water pollution act and ridem water quality regulations.a administrative penalty was imposed.ridem issued a letter on november,confirming the receipt of a check from jf realty to pay the penalty and that all issues mentioned in the nov were resolved,effectively releasing the.subsequent inspections in april found no additional violations and resulted in no additional enforcement actions or fines.
ii.procedural background 
filed the current claim for injunctive relief and civil penalties against jf realty,ferreira,yabroudy,lkq,advanced auto,and ferreira as trustee of the ferreira trust under the citizen suit enforcement provisions of the cwa on january,in the district court for the district of rhode island,alleging that contaminated stormwater runoff from the property was being discharged into united states waters,contaminating the property,and that defendants lacked a valid ripdes permit.while the claim was originally dismissed on july,due to defective notice,this court reversed the dismissal and remanded except as to claims against ferreira business manager,yabroudy.paolino jf realty,llc,cir.the deadline for plaintiffs to submit expert disclosures was february.although plaintiffs provided disclosures for two expert witnesses on that date,alvin snyder and robert roseen,the latter report was just pages,some of which were stamped draft.subsequently submitted a request to supplement roseen report on june,which was,noted the district court,more than three months after the plaintiffs expert disclosures were due,two weeks after expert discovery had closed,and after the defendants had filed their motion for summary judgment,based,in part,on the information disclosed in roseen expert report.the second report was seventy pages.despite a may deposition,neither roseen nor had indicated any intention to revise or supplement the february report.the parties proceeded to trial,which took place over seven days in august and september,at which the district court permitted roseen to testify only to the content of the initial report.the district court issued a memorandum of decision on november,concluding that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof.
on december,defendants filed a motion for attorney fees claiming that plaintiffs went to trial without credible evidence paolino conceded that ridem had investigated the property and found his complaints lacked merit and neither ridem nor the epa chose to intervene.plaintiffs filed an objection to this motion,arguing that their action was not frivolous or unreasonable,that the lack of action by administrative agencies is not definitive,and that defendants were seeking fees related to prior suits.on march,the district court ordered that the plaintiffs pay,the total amount of fees charged by defendants counsel from june,the date by which extensive discovery had been completed and plaintiffs had reviewed and responded to defendants motion for summary judgment,to october.
iii.the excluded expert testimony 
allege that the trial judge erred in excluding from evidence a portion of the expert testimony of roseen as a result of tardiness in filing roseen revised expert report.this claim faces a high bar and falls well short.
when reviewing a district court sanction regarding a discovery violation,this court will be deferential to the trial judge.see macaulay anas,cir.when a party aspires to disclose expert evidence out of time and the trial court opts to exclude it,we review that determination for abuse of discretion.laboratorio clínico y de referencia del este,cir.under the abuse of discretion standard,this court will not substitute its judgment for that of the district court unless left with a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment.schubert nissan motor in,cir.quoting in re josephson,cir.
under federal rule of civil procedure e 
a party who has made a disclosure under rule a or who has responded to an interrogatory,request for production,or request for admission must supplement or correct its disclosure or response a in a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect,and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing or b as ordered by the court.
fed.civ.e.pursuant to rule c,reports that are not disclosed in a timely manner are automatically excluded and may not be used to supply evidence unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.fed.civ.c.in esposito home depot,this court stated that when reviewing a district court decision to preclude expert testimony,it will consider the history of the litigation the sanctioned party need for the precluded evidence the sanctioned party justification for its late disclosure the ability to overcome the late disclosure adverse effects and the late disclosure impact on the district court docket,cir.
we find that,far from an abuse of discretion,the district court decision to exclude the untimely supplement to roseen report passes the esposito test easily.regarding the history of the litigation,repeatedly missed deadlines for discovery and motions.see esposito,at.while contend that the information is crucial to their case,presented numerous other forms of evidence as well as nine other witnesses moreover,roseen was allowed to testify only the untimely portion of his report was excluded.claim their tardiness owed to defendants refusal to permit them entry onto the property.but concede that they did not file a motion to obtain an order to inspect the property as opposed to a request for entry until february,though experts reports were to be disclosed by february.moreover,did not retain roseen until early february,further undermining asserted justification for their tardiness.as to the fourth esposito factor,as the district court noted,motion to serve a revised expert report came months after the deadline for expert disclosures had passed and only after the defendants had filed their motion for summary judgment.defendants had already relied on the original report from roseen in drafting their motion for summary judgment.to grant the request to supplement roseen report on june would have substantially affected both defendants,who had tangibly relied upon that initial disclosure,and the district court.see,at gagnon teledyne princeton,cir.
fatal sanction argument likewise fails.in esposito,the plaintiff need for the expert was so great that the magistrate judge decision to preclude the expert,although technically not a dismissal of esposito case,effectively amounted to one.at.granted,when preclusion carrie s the force of a dismissal,the justification for it must be comparatively more robust.id.at see young gordon,cir.but here the preclusion of a portion of an expert witness report in this case following discovery,rather than before a successful motion for summary judgment,did not constitute a de facto dismissal.roseen was still allowed to testify,along with other witnesses,and the dismissal can not be attributed to the exclusion of the supplement to roseen tardily tendered report.we thus find no abuse of discretion in the district court decision to exclude the revised report.
iv.the judgment 
we next address contention that the trial judge judgment for the appellees was an error in toto and somehow against the great weight of the evidence presented at trial.
pursuant to the cwa citizen suit provision a ny citizen may commence a civil action on his own behalf against any person who is alleged to be in violation of a an effluent standard or limitation under this chapter or b an order issued by the administrator or a state with respect to such a standard or limitation.a.here,sought to prove defendants violated the cwa by discharging pollutants from a point source into navigable waters without a permit.a,a.specifically,had to prove that water discharged from the stormwater system outfall pipes into the mingled channel leading to curran brook contained pollutants 
upon review,this court may set aside the district court findings of fact only if clearly erroneous and with due regard for the opportunity of the trial judge to determine the credibility of the witnesses.fed.civ.a see also jackson harvard,cir.conversely,this court reviews legal rulings by the district court on a de novo basis.united states bosworth,cir.
in anderson bessemer city,the supreme court established that 
i f the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.
here,the district court order was clearly grounded in the record and reflected a interpretation of that evidence.that court recounted the extensive procedural history,incorporating prior decisions summarized the pertinent testimony of thirteen witnesses and the findings of facts corresponding to each reviewed the timeline of events based on testimony and evidence offered by both parties in relation to the cwa claim and noted dem investigations,actions,and notifications.
the district court determined that the only evidence presented to show the stormwater system was discharging pollutants was overtly flawed.for example,roseen report significantly misapprehends the stormwater system components and their functions.as patrick hogan of ridem noted in his testimony,all of snyder samples came from a mingled water source,not directly from the property or the property outfall pipes.as such,it is no stretch to affirm the district court finding that failed to show the stormwater system was emitting pollutants.
further,we note cwa claim failed in another direction a exists to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the n ation waters.in the past,we have held that d uplicative actions aimed at exacting financial penalties in the name of environmental protection at a time when remedial measures are well underway do not further this goal and may be impediments to environmental remedy efforts.rivers watershed ass n,town of scituate,cir.w hen it appears that governmental action under either the federal or comparable state clean water acts begins and is diligently prosecuted,the need for citizen suits vanishes.id.at see gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay.here,ample evidence demonstrates ridem ongoing involvement vis the property and responsiveness to repeated complaints and concerns,vitiating the premise that a citizen suit is necessary at all.
finally,argument that jf realty violated the cwa by failing to properly transfer the ripdes permit is.rely on new manchester resort golf,llc,in which the district court for the northern district of georgia established that the cwa authorizes citizen suits for the enforcement of all conditions of a permit.new manchester resort golf,llc douglasville,llc,supp,quoting culbertson coats,supp.however,it is important to distinguish,as jf realty did,that the permit violations in dispute in that case were failing to maintain best management practices,violating georgia water quality standards,and ignoring monitoring and reporting requirements.id.at.these substantive violations are hardly equivalent to a failure to properly notify ridem of a transfer of ownership,especially given that the both the transferor the ferreira trust and the recipient jf realty were controlled by the same person,ferreira the identity of the current owner was known to ridem and the current owner was complying with the relevant regulations.
v.the fee award 
at last,we turn to the question of attorney fees.the cwa citizen suit provision states that the court,in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to this section,may award costs of litigation including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees to any prevailing or substantially prevailing party,whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.d.attorney fees may be awarded to a prevailing defendant if it is found that the plaintiff action was frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation,even though not brought in subjective bad faith,cir.quoting rosselló gonzález acevedo vilá,cir.although determinations about whether to award attorney fees are generally focused on the claims as they existed at the time the complaint was filed,fees also may be awarded on rare occasions where the plaintiff continued to litigate after the claims clearly became frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.municipality of adjuntas,cir.quoting,at alterations and emphasis in original internal citations omitted.here,again,we review for abuse of discretion,thus we will not lightly substitute our judgment for that of the district court,at.
the district court here provided a detailed basis for awarding attorney fees that precludes finding a clear error of judgment.schubert,at quoting josephson,at,at.the district court reviewed relevant facts carefully and noted that plaintiffs brought the current suit after defendants installed a comprehensive stormwater management system per ridem,that paolino had been repeatedly informed by ridem that,with one exception,his complaints about the property had no merit,and that complaints generated various site visits,a inspection,and extensive correspondence between ridem,epa,and local authorities.the district court found that refused to acknowledge the efforts made by ridem that caused the defendants to alleviate environmental conditions on the property.
the district court also noted attempt to seek an injunction to return the property to its previous condition as a request to undo beneficial changes to the property at great expense to the defendants that was wholly inconsistent with a citizen plaintiff who legitimately seeks to prosecute violations of the cwa for the public good.the district court further detailed lack of diligence in pursuing the suit against defendants,evidenced by waiting six months to submit their written discovery requests,failing to provide adequate water samples on which to base their complaints despite notice by ridem of the need to do so,allowing discovery and motion deadlines to pass,attempting to submit testimony of events that had occurred decades before relevant events,and failing to retain a water resources engineering expert to investigate,make findings,and produce a report on the property until two weeks before the deadline for disclosure.
while the court concedes plaintiffs may have had a reasonable claim in,by the facts had changed considerably.in essence,the district court concluded,with good reason,that it is 
abundantly clear that the plaintiffs continued to engage in a bitter quarrel with the defendants long after the defendants had taken appropriate and measures to address any legitimate concerns the plaintiffs might have raised in the interest of protecting public water resources and long after it became apparent that the plaintiffs case was unsupportable.
moreover,the district court carefully detailed its reasoning as to the amount of the award.although defendants requested fees covering billing hours charged since august,the court noted that defendants had failed to request attorney fees in the prior two cases and limited its consideration of their request to the instant case.the court focused its inquiry on when it became clear that the plaintiffs claims against the defendants were groundless,granting that i t is not an easy task to pinpoint the exact moment at which it should have been apparent to the plaintiffs that their continuing litigation lacked merit.only after reviewing the procedural history and availability and persuasiveness of evidence and notifications throughout did the court determine that it was as of june,after the plaintiffs had conducted extensive discovery,engaged experts,and reviewed and responded to defendants motion for summary judgment,that it was clear that further litigation against the defendants was both unreasonable and groundless.
as the district court carefully detailed its analysis and the underlying factual basis for its conclusion,we see no ground for a finding of clear error or any basis under schubert for this court to substitute its judgment for that of the district court.at.
vi.conclusion 
the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
plaintiffs originally filed suit in rhode island state court in.after plaintiffs amended the complaint to include counts under the cwa,the resources conservation and recovery act rcra,et,and the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,et,defendants removed the case to federal court and asserted that notice was inadequate.on march,the court dismissed plaintiffs federal claims without prejudice for failure to comply with the notice requirements of the various statutes invoked,and remanded the remaining state claims to the rhode island superior court.lm nursing,ferreira,wl,at.on june,plaintiffs filed a new federal complaint against the defendants in the district of rhode island,which was dismissed without prejudice by stipulation when notice was defective.paolino jf realty,llc,cir.
this is one of many points of temporal murkiness.the complaint states that the permit request was filed on june,while the answer claims the request was filed in june.the answer does not refute the claim that at the time of application the owner was jf realty and operator was lkq.
around the same time,in,paolino communicated to yabroudy that he wanted ferreira to purchase the property for ferreira refused.subsequently filed their first lawsuit against the defendants for the contamination of the property and lodged complaints about the property with ridem,the environmental protection agency epa,the attorney office,the police department,the department of business relations,and senator sheldon whitehouse.to this considerable barrage,they added a media campaign.
turbidity,as opposed to pollutant levels,does not bear on whether defendants were in violation of the cwa or their permit,thus we do not address the issue of turbidity.
the district court reviewed evidence from christopher lee,a field technician employed by rhode island analytical laboratories who took samples at the property on december,and took a sample from the drainage channel located partially on the property and no samples from the property alvin snyder,registered professional engineer and the principal of environmental resource associates,a company dedicated to environmental compliance and remediation,who made various visits to,and took various samples from,the property between and harold ellis,a former supervising environmental scientist with ridem,who only offered testimony relating to events that occurred thirty years or more before the complaint louis maccarone ii,senior sanitary engineer at the ridem office of waste management,who sent a letter of responsibility to the ferreira trust on october,requiring the owners of the property to conduct a full site investigation and bring the property into compliance with regulations david chopy,ridem chief of compliance and inspection,who confirmed receiving data from snyder that appeared to demonstrate water quality violations but that could not be used because snyder was hired by paolino paolino,of the property,who saw oil sheen and turbidity in the water coming from the property onto his,but also conceded that his complaints were investigated by ridem and were deemed to not have merit david holzinger,operations manager for lkq,who described the process of auto recycling at the lkq facility,his obligation to collect stormwater samples every quarter,and the requirements to prevent contamination yabroudy,business manager for ferreira,who applied for a ripdes permit on june,that named the trust as the owner of the property and advanced auto as the operator although advanced auto was dissolved in and the property was conveyed to jf realty ferreira,who bought the property in and serves as lkq plant manager and stated he had no direct involvement with ridem although he was aware of their notices and of how the stormwater management system was installed roseen,a in civil engineering with a specialty in water resources engineering,who analyzed data collected by his staff from the property in as to potential risks of contamination in light of the current system and reviewed maintenance records from to patrick hogan,in charge of supervising the ridem water pollution and septic enforcement program,who visited the property on various occasions between and after receiving complaints from paolino and sent an noi to jf realty after a march visit and an nov following a november visit,but affirmed that jf realty took the necessary steps to address both and informed paolino,in response to continuing complaints,that a multimedia inspection found no violations karen beck,a commonwealth engineering employee,registered landscape architect,and wetlands scientist,who worked on the design of the property stormwater management system,obtained the necessary permits,and coordinated efforts by commonwealth engineers and richard lavengood,engineer and certifi
