plaintiffs walter greb now deceased and his wife karen greb appeal from the order of the trial court sustaining,without leave to amend,defendant diamond international corporation demurrer to the complaint.the court concluded defendant,a dissolved delaware corporation,lacked the capacity to be sued because plaintiffs lawsuit was filed more than three years after defendant dissolution.we affirm.
factual background and procedural history 
on december,plaintiffs filed a complaint for personal injury and loss of consortium against defendant and several other defendants.the complaint alleged greb had suffered injury from exposure to asbestos and products.
on february,defendant filed a demurrer to the complaint.in the demurrer,defendant alleged it had obtained a corporate dissolution in accordance with the laws of delaware on july.it asserted it lacked the capacity to be sued when the present complaint was filed because delaware general corporation law section provides that a dissolved corporation shall continue to exist for purposes of winding up its affairs,including prosecuting and defending lawsuits,for a period of only three years from the date of dissolution.because plaintiffs complaint was filed more than three years after the dissolution,defendant claimed the lawsuit was barred.
on march,plaintiffs filed their opposition to defendant demurrer.they argued the lawsuit was permitted under california corporations code section section,which they asserted took precedence over delaware law.after the hearing on the demurrer,defendant was allowed to file a surreply brief,which it did on march.
on may,the trial court sustained defendant demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend.
on june,the trial court filed its order dismissing the complaint with prejudice.this appeal followed 
discussion 
standard of review 
the resolution of the present case turns on whether california corporations code section applies to a dissolved delaware corporation.appellate courts may independently determine the proper interpretation of a statute,as it entails the resolution of a pure question of law.we therefore apply a de novo standard of review.farm raised salmon cases cal th,fn.d.
ii.alleged conflict of law 
it is undisputed that the instant lawsuit was filed on december,more than three years after july,the date on which defendant formally dissolved.relying on north american asbestos superior court d.north american ii,plaintiffs claim california corporations code section permits lawsuits to be filed against a dissolved foreign corporation irrespective of the date of dissolution.california corporations code section provides that a corporation which is dissolved nevertheless continues to exist for the purpose of winding up its affairs,prosecuting and defending actions by or against it it further states that no action or proceeding to which a corporation is a party abates by the dissolution of the corporation or by reason of proceedings for winding up and dissolution thereof.invoking principles,plaintiffs contend the trial court should have applied california law rather than the limitation contained in title,section of the delaware general corporation law.
analysis of a question proceeds in three steps first,the court determines whether the relevant law of each of the potentially affected jurisdictions with regard to the particular issue in question is the same or different.second,if there is a difference,the court examines each jurisdiction interest in the application of its own law under the circumstances of the particular case to determine whether a true conflict exists.third,if the court finds that there is a true conflict,it carefully evaluates and compares the nature and strength of the interest of each jurisdiction in the application of its own law to determine which state interest would be more impaired if its policy were subordinated to the policy of the other state citation,and then ultimately applies the law of the state whose interest would be the more impaired if its law were not applied.citation.kearney salomon smith barney,cal th,d.we note,however,the fact that two states are involved does not in itself indicate that there is a conflict of laws or choice of law problem.hurtado superior court cal d.
iii.dissolved corporations at common law 
at common law,upon a dissolution,a corporation ceased to exist for any purpose.it could not be bound civilly nor prosecuted criminally any more than a natural person who had died.peacock,hasko d.see also title wilcox.in response to this consequence,principles of equity were implemented to create a judicial concept known as the trust fund doctrine.delaney crystal.this rule allowed creditors an equitable right to follow corporate assets after a dissolution,so that the assets were held in a trust which gave the creditors superior claim to that of the shareholders of the corporation.over time,jurisdictions found the trust fund doctrine a fuzzy concept to implement and legislatures developed statutes,sharp and definite,to regulate corporate liability and obligations postdissolution.fletcher cyclopedia of the law of corporations,riley fitzgerald d.riley.s hareholders nonetheless possess an important statutory interest in the final and certain termination of their involvement with the affairs of a dissolving corporation.pacific scene,peñasquitos,cal d.
under the restatement second of conflict of laws,whether a corporation continues its existence after it has dissolved or been suspended is decided by the state of incorporation.rest d conf.of laws.this principle applies even where corporate assets are situated elsewhere or all corporate business is conducted in other states.rest d conf.of laws,com.a.additionally,states of incorporation will often have statutes that extend corporate life facilitating the opportunity for creditor claims against the dissolved business such laws are recognized in other states including the forum state.rest d conf.of laws,coms.d e.
most states,including delaware,limit the period within which a newly dissolved corporation may sue or be sued postdissolution.moreover,it is the state of incorporation that will generally control this extended existence based on legislative acquiescence.but corporations exist for specific purposes,and only by legislative act,so that if the life of the corporation is to continue even only for litigating purposes it is necessary that there should be some statutory authority for the prolongation.the matter is really not procedural or controlled by the rules of the court in which the litigation pends.it concerns the fundamental law of the corporation enacted by the state which brought the corporation into being.oklahoma gas oklahoma,emphasis added see also bazan kux machine,products liability claim johnson helicopter airplane services,products liability claim stone gibson refrigerator sales corporation,products liability claim.
california corporation law,corporations code section forth no time limitation for suing a dissolved california corporation.resolution of this case thus turns on whether california corporations code section may be applied to corporations incorporated in states,such as delaware,with statutes that do set time limits on lawsuits involving corporate parties.
iv.delaware law regarding dissolved corporations 
delaware courts have held that the existence or nonexistence of a delaware corporation is governed by delaware law.in re transamerica airlines.ch.may.ch.lexis.section of the delaware general corporation law provides,in part all corporations,whether they expire by their own limitation or are otherwise dissolved,shall nevertheless be continued,for the term of years from such expiration or dissolution or for such longer period as the court of chancery shall in its discretion direct,as bodies corporate for the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits,whether civil,criminal or administrative,by or against them,and of enabling them gradually to settle and close their business,to dispose of and convey their property,to discharge their liabilities and to distribute to their stockholders any remaining assets,but not for the purpose of continuing the business for which the corporation was organized.based on this provision,delaware courts have held that new lawsuits may not be initiated against the dissolved corporation after the period has expired.in re dow chemical international.ch.ch.lexis.
delaware courts have observed that the state survival statute may operate to the detriment of parties,such as plaintiffs,whose claims arise after the expiration of the corporate survival period this modern scheme still leaves open the question,what,if any,rights are afforded to persons who have no claim against a corporation at the time of its dissolution,or during the statutory period,but who do thereafter acquire such a claim.such a person might,for example,be a tort claimant who is injured by an arguably defective product some time after,perhaps years after,the corporation has been dissolved,and its affairs finally.it would seem apparent that such a person could not sue the dissolved corporation itself.section continues the corporation existence beyond the statutory three year period solely for the purpose of concluding pending litigation.in re rego,civ.
in the recent case of territory of the united states virgin islands goldman,sachs,civ,the creditors of a dissolved delaware corporation attempted to sue the corporation former shareholders more than three years after its dissolution.the delaware court held that because no judgment could be recovered against a dissolved delaware corporation after the survival limit under delaware general corporation law section,a suit could not be maintained against the shareholders of the corporation under delaware general corporation law section,subdivision b goldman,sachs,supra,at.
courts in other jurisdictions have also held that delaware general corporation law section operates to bar lawsuits brought against dissolved delaware corporations after the period.although not technically a statute of limitations,section has been held to be a clear expression of a legislative policy normally prohibiting the commencement of actions by or against dissolved corporations more than three years after their dissolution.citation.courts have consistently concluded that upon expiration of the period,the corporation ceases to exist as a legal entity and no claims may be asserted against it.citations.as the complaint in this case was filed in,almost thirteen years after the corporate defendant was dissolved,the town assertion of state law claims against the defendant is prohibited by delaware law.town of oyster bay occidental chemical.
delaware survival statute was also enforced by the second circuit court of appeals.in marsh rosenbloom cir,the court found that the new york state plaintiffs were barred from asserting a claim against a delaware corporation and the corporation former shareholders because the survival period had expired before the lawsuit was filed.marsh,supra,at.in so holding,the court explained delaware statute was enacted in order to formalize the continued existence of corporate assets and to provide a mechanism for the assertion of claims as part of the winding up process continuing the corporation existence by operation of law.citation.like other statutes,section provides that any suit against the corporation,which was filed before dissolution or during the three year statutory period,does not abate,even on the expiration of the period.citation.when the period expires,however,so does the corporation capacity to be sued.id.at,fn.omitted.
in town of oyster bay and marsh,the alleged tortuous conduct predated the dissolution of the particular delaware corporation.yet,because the lawsuits were filed more than three years after the enterprises dissolved,the statutory purpose of delaware general corporation law section kicked in.the period had passed and consequently,the corporations ability to be held responsible for alleged injury terminated.
conflict in the court of appeal 
california,as a general rule,has routinely held the law of the state of incorporation determines the consequence of corporate dissolution.citing the restatement of conflict of laws,one court has noted it appears to be settled law that the effect of the dissolution of a corporation,or its expiration otherwise,depends upon the law of its domicile citations citations.macmillan petroleum griffin d,see also,fidelity metals risley d,and cases cited therein.
with this background in mind,we proceed to consider the merits of the present case.the parties acknowledge that two california appellate cases published within two months of each other in frame the issue in this appeal riley,supra,d,and north american ii,supra,d.riley holds that california corporations code section does not apply to foreign dissolved corporations.riley,supra,at.north american ii holds that california corporations code section conflicts with,and prevails over,foreign corporation laws that limit survival periods of dissolved corporations.north american ii,supra,at.
north american ii 
in north american ii,the defendant,a dissolved illinois corporation,had brought a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs lawsuit was barred because it was filed more than two years after the corporation had dissolved.north american ii,supra,d.when the complaint was filed,illinois law provided that the dissolution of a corporation did not impair any remedy for a liability incurred prior to dissolution if action or other proceeding thereon is commenced within two years after the date of such dissolution,ch,unless a recognized exception applied.id.at.the corporation had previously filed its articles of dissolution and had received a certificate of dissolution from the secretary of state of illinois on may.the lawsuit at issue was filed on december,more than two years later.ibid.after proceeding with a analysis,the appellate court held the trial court was correct in applying california law instead of illinois law and in denying the motion for summary judgment.central to this holding was the court finding that california corporations code section applies to foreign corporations.north american ii,supra,at.
interestingly,the opinion in north american ii was a reversal of that same court reasoning as expressed in north american asbestos superior court d.north american i in arriving at its revised holding,the court in north american ii recognized it had stated in north american i that california corporations code section applies only to domestic corporations.north american ii,supra,d.following somewhat convoluted reasoning,the court reversed its prior conclusion by turning to former article xii,section of the california constitution,a provision that was repealed in.north american ii,supra,at.that section,adopted in,had stated no corporation organized outside the limits of this state shall be allowed to transact business within this state on more favorable conditions than are prescribed by law to similar corporations organized under the laws of this state.the north american ii court concluded that,consistent with the constitutional provision,california corporations code section was intended to apply to both foreign and domestic corporations when its predecessor was first enacted in north american ii,supra,at.while the court acknowledged definitional sections in the corporations code had been amended after so that the term corporation used in corporations code section could arguably have come to mean only a domestic corporation,north american ii,supra,at the court concluded the electorate did not intend to alter the original meaning of corporations code section when it repealed article xii,section of the california constitution.north american ii,supra,at.
repeating the reasoning of north american ii,plaintiffs here contend the repeal of article xii,section,of the california constitution shows a legislative intent that california corporations code section apply to foreign corporations.it is well established,however,that legislative intent should not be resorted to where a statute is clear on its face.in determining legislative intent,courts look first to the words of the statute itself if those words have a meaning,as we hold they do here,there is no need for construction and courts should not indulge in it.arnett dal cielo cal th,d.
importantly,the majority in north american ii did not acknowledge the conflicting case of riley,a second district case that was published some two months earlier.in riley,the sole shareholders of a texas corporation had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the corporation after expiration of the postdissolution survival period provided by texas law.riley,supra,d.on appeal,the plaintiffs claimed california corporations code section created a conflict with the texas statute and that california law should apply.riley,supra,at.in disagreeing with this contention,the appellate court in riley observed it is settled law in california that the effect of corporate dissolution or expiration depends upon the law of its domicile,and a defunct foreign corporation has no greater capacity or higher standing to initiate or maintain an action in the forum state than it would have in its domiciliary state.id.at.citing to north american i,the court in riley concluded that california corporations code section does not apply to foreign corporations.riley,supra,at.the court also observed that california corporations code section specifies the california corporations code provisions that apply to foreign corporations to the exclusion of the law of the jurisdiction in which they are incorporated.conspicuous by its absence is section.riley,supra,at.the court reasoned that the effect of corporate dissolution or extinguishment depends upon the law of the corporation domicile.ibid.
plaintiffs attempt to distinguish riley because the corporate shareholders in that case had brought suit against california residents and entities,whereas north american ii,like the case at bar,involved california residents suing a foreign corporation.they claim riley is therefore not on point.plaintiffs also contend that the discussion concerning california corporations code section in riley was dicta because the plaintiffs in that case had already stipulated that texas law applied and that they had therefore waived the choice of law issue.while the court in riley acknowledged the parties stipulated that texas law applied in the case,the decision holds even if rileys did not waive the issue of choice of law,texas law would still apply.riley,supra,d,emphasis added.plaintiffs still argue that the trial court in the present case was bound to follow north american ii and should therefore have overruled defendant demurrer.we are not persuaded that the trial court erred and,in any event,the argument is inapposite because we are reviewing the issue as a matter of law and are not ourselves bound by other court of appeal decisions.
plaintiffs also rely on peñasquitos,superior court cal d.in that case,the supreme court held that parties may bring suit against dissolved corporations for damages that occurred or are discovered after dissolution.peñasquitos involved homeowners who sued a dissolved california corporation that had improperly graded their housing lots.in concluding that california corporations code section applied,the court described both north american opinions.significantly,the court did not discuss or disapprove the holding in riley,even though it was clearly aware of that case as it cited to riley in a string cite after noting that a t common law,the dissolution of a corporation was treated like the death of a natural person peñasquitos,supra,at.as the facts of peñasquitos did not involve a foreign corporation,the court discussion of north american ii is dicta only,which we are not bound to follow.people macias cal th,d.this court also makes a similar observation of the reference to north american ii in the recent case of mccann foster wheeler llc cal th,d.
california corporations code section does not apply to foreign corporations 
california corporations code section provides that,with certain exceptions not applicable here,the provisions of the corporations code apply to domestic corporations only,and that application to other corporations is permitted only to the extent expressly included in a particular provision of this division.italics added.california corporations code section makes no mention of foreign corporations.in contrast,for example,california corporations code section annual report to shareholders states at subdivision g this section applies to any domestic corporation and also to a foreign corporation having its principal executive office in this state or customarily holding meetings of its board in this state.
plaintiffs claim that california corporations code section applies to all foreign corporations,relying on subdivision a reference to corporations organized under this division.they reason that section sets forth two categories of corporations corporations organized under this division and domestic corporations not subject to the specified divisions or parts.they further argue that corporations organized under this division must be read to include foreign corporations because a contrary interpretation would render the statutory language superfluous.the argument is flawed.
in the first place,plaintiffs do not cite to any authority for the proposition that foreign corporations are covered under california general corporation law division.it is also a substantial stretch to conclude that a corporation from another state can fairly be characterized as one organized under the california corporations code.moreover,plaintiffs position conflicts with california corporations code section,which provides corporation,unless otherwise expressly provided,refers only to a corporation organized under this division or a corporation subject to this division under the provisions of subdivision a of section.in our view,these statutes evince a clear intent to limit the corporations code general application to domestic corporations.
further,the corporations code does include sections that apply specifically to foreign corporations.chapter commencing with contains many provisions that apply to foreign corporations.significantly,as noted by the appellate court in riley,supra,d,section,which identifies all of the chapters and sections of the california corporations code that apply to foreign corporations meeting certain threshold requirements,does not mention section.
again relying on north american ii,supra,d,plaintiffs argue that california corporations code section only applies to the mechanics of corporate life which would ordinarily be directed just to domestic corporations see north american ii,supra,at and is limited to corporations that meet its threshold requirements.further,they argue that california corporations code section is not the type of mechanical rule that one would expect to have been enumerated by corporations code section.suffice it to say,we disagree with the reasoning of north american ii,and therefore find this argument to be without merit.had the legislature intended for corporations code section to apply to foreign corporations,it would have stated so explicitly.
clark williard.does not compel a different conclusion.in that case the united states supreme court upheld a montana court conclusion that a montana statute allowed suit against a dissolved iowa corporation because the statute provided that all foreign corporations licensed to do business in montana were subject to all liabilities,restrictions,and duties imposed upon corporations of like character organized under the laws of montana.id.at.the same rationale does not apply in the present case because california corporations code does not contain a similar provision.in sum,we conclude delaware law controls whether defendant is amenable to suit following dissolution.this conclusion obviates the need to proceed any further with a analysis.as the instant lawsuit was filed more than three years after defendant dissolution,the trial court correctly sustained defendant demurrer to the complaint.
disposition 
to adopt the interpretation propounded by appellant would render particular sections such as section and section of the california corporations code meaningless.with california corporations code section as a
