thekla nordwind and greta hoerman,gerald taylor as executor of the estate of michael franke,and peter,collectively the plaintiffs or the nordwind parties,appeal from a summary judgment entered on october,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york pogue,sitting by designation,in favor of the plaintiffs former counsel david rowland rowland and rowland associates,and rowland petroff,collectively,the defendants.as relevant to this appeal,the district court dismissed the nordwind parties claims against the defendants for breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,and negligence,as duplicative of the plaintiffs claim against the defendants for legal malpractice and the nordwind parties legal malpractice claim against the defendants because,pursuant to german law,the nordwind parties would have only been entitled to of the subject inheritance regardless of rowland alleged malpractice and denied the nordwind parties claim of unjust enrichment and request to disqualify rowland from further representation of clients whose interests in the subject inheritance are adverse to the nordwind parties interests.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
a.the kirstein assets 
clara and gustav kirstein lived in leipzig,germany with their two daughters,gabrielle and marianna,in the.they were a close jewish family of means.gustav,who was a renowned art publisher and art collector,died in,leaving a life estate in all of his assets to his wife clara and the remainder to marianna and gabrielle in equal shares.
before his death,gustav had experienced the beginnings of nazi persecution when his business was subjected to a forced sale.faced with the continuing rise of nazi power,clara sent her two daughters to the united states after gustav death.clara,intending to emigrate to the united states after her daughters,remained in germany to sell whatever she could of her remaining artwork and business and to ship the balance of her artwork and other personal property to new york,where she planned to join her family.on june,however,the nazis confiscated clara passport and denied her permission to leave germany.that night,clara returned to her home in leipzig and committed suicide.thereafter,the nazis confiscated her assets the kirstein assets,which included the artwork and other property that had been packed for shipment to the united states.
nearly fifty years later,in,marianna died in new york state,leaving her son klaus baer as the sole heir of her estate.klaus baer died in in the state of illinois,leaving his residuary estate in a trust benefitting his wife miriam reitz baer miriam baer,who survives him,for her lifetime with the remainder to the oriental institute of the university of chicago the oriental institute.
the other kirstein daughter,gabrielle,died in new york state in.she left her estate to her husband,erich jacobsen.erich jacobsen died in new york state in,and the bulk of his estate passed to his and gabrielle son,godfrey jacobsen,who was named the residual beneficiary in erich jacobsen will.godfrey jacobsen died in new york state in,leaving a substantial amount of his property to christel gauger gauger,a nurse who had been with the jacobsens for over years.gauger,who had cared for godfrey jacobsen since the time he was old,was named the residual beneficiary of godfrey jacobsen estate.after godfrey jacobsen death,gauger returned to her home in germany and resided there until her death,which occurred during the pendency of this appeal 
b.the nordwind parties seek restitution 
in,germany enacted the german property restitution law the german property act,which provided a limited time for certain persons to assert claims of restitution arising from the illegal confiscation of properties by the nazi government.see vermögensgesetz vermg settlement of pending property claims,bundesgesetzblatt,teil i translated.under the german property act,claimants had until december,for real estate claims,and june,for movable property claims,to file for restitution.qualifying persons,namely,the original owners of the confiscated property or their heirs,who failed to file a claim for restitution by the deadline forfeited their rights.the conference on jewish material claims against germany,the jcc,succeeded to any unclaimed rights to the confiscated properties.the jcc,in turn,created the goodwill fund to permit jewish owners or their heirs who missed the december,and june,filing deadlines under the german property act to file claims with the jcc to receive a portion of their restitution claims.the deadline for filing a claim under the goodwill fund,as relevant to the events giving rise to this appeal,was december.
in september of,the nordwind parties,who are nieces and nephews of clara kirstein,became aware of the possibility that they may be entitled to recover restitution for the kirstein assets.after conducting research on the internet,the nordwind parties retained defendant rowland on october,to file a claim to the kirstein assets and to maximize their recovery on the claim to the extent possible.thekla nordwind provided rowland with an exhaustive family tree,numerous documents from clara kirstein,including an exhaustive listing of the kirstein assets confiscated from her,her last will and testament,and that of her husband gustav,and the last will and testament of klaus baer,among other documents.in light of the impending december,deadline to file a claim with the jcc goodwill fund for restitution,rowland advised the nordwind parties that all of the heirs or possible heirs,including nieces and nephews of clar a kirstein,should file a claim with the jcc by the end of this year to preserve all possible rights.
in november,rowland identified miriam baer as a potential heir to the kirstein assets.although miriam baer did not wish to file a claim to the kirstein assets for her own benefit,rowland advised her to do so and she retained him by a letter dated november,to represent her in the restitution claim.thereafter,based on the information furnished to him by thekla nordwind,rowland obtained a copy of godfrey jacobsen will and identified another potential heir to the kirstein assets as christel gauger.rowland then contacted gauger,informed her of her potential interest in the kirstein assets,and offered to represent her in their retrieval.gauger retained rowland by a letter agreement dated december.
at no point did rowland inform the nordwind parties of any potential conflicts of interests arising from his representation of persons who might hold interests adverse to the nordwind parties.rowland did inform the nordwind parties,however,that b oth miriam reitz baer and christel gauger have indicated that they may wish to assign their rights to clar a kirstein nieces and nephews,the nordwind parties,at some time in the future.rowland had also informed the nordwind parties that only heirs are eligible to file claims under the german property act,a prerequisite status to the assertion of a claim to the jcc goodwill fund.although it is disputed whether rowland received oral consent from the nordwind parties to contact gauger and offer his services,it is undisputed that rowland never obtained a written waiver from them to do so.
on december,rowland filed a restitution claim with the jcc goodwill fund on behalf of only miriam baer and gauger as heirs to the kirstein assets.the following year,on december,miriam baer and the oriental institute assigned their interests in the kirstein assets to the nordwind parties.gauger,however,refused to assign her interests in the kirstein assets to the nordwind parties.
in connection with the restitution claims filed with the jcc goodwill fund,rowland also filed applications for erbscheins a german certificate of inheritance to establish,inter alios,gauger entitlement to the kirstein assets.although there is a mechanism to contest the issuance of erbscheins,rowland did not inform the nordwind parties of their right to contest gauger erbschein application.on january,the german surrogate court issued three erbscheins relevant to gauger claim to the kirstein assets.the german surrogate court issued an erbschein naming erich jacobsen and godfrey jacobsen as the heirs of gabrielle jacobsen an erbschein naming godfrey jacobsen as the heir of erich jacobsen and an erbschein naming gauger as the heir of godfrey jacobsen these erbscheins were then submitted to the jcc goodwill fund in support of gauger restitution claim to the kirstein assets.
while the jcc claim remained pending,thekla nordwind,acting pro se and representing the nordwind parties,filed a separate claim in the claims resolution tribunal the crt in the claim was for swiss bank account assets that had been confiscated from clara kirstein during the nazi era.with respect to this claim,the district court described the disputed underlying events 
rowland claim s that gauger had consented to nordwind filing at the crt,but had not consented to be joined or to participate at all,and had not agreed to assign her interest from any recovery to the nordwind parties.the nordwind parties contend that gauger had agreed to assign her interest to them,and had agreed to sign over her power of attorney to nordwind,but that when rowland,at the request of nordwind,contacted gauger,the situation ended with rowland representing gauger before the crt.
nordwind rowland,wl,at.
in february,the jcc goodwill fund rendered an award of restitution for the kirstein assets,apparently in the millions of dollars,to miriam baer and gauger in equal shares.although the nordwind parties would ultimately receive miriam baer share of the restitution award pursuant to the earlier executed december,assignment,the nordwind parties were excluded from the restitution award because the jcc goodwill fund did not recognize any assignment of rights.following the restitution award,the jcc goodwill fund informed the nordwind parties that they were bound by the claim to the kirstein assets filed by rowland and were precluded from filing a new claim,in their own right,to the kirstein assets under the applicable rules of the jcc.in december,the nordwind parties terminated rowland as their representative.
in january,the crt awarded the nordwind parties in connection with their claim to swiss bank account assets that were confiscated from clara kirstein by the nazis.after rowland submitted gauger erbschein to the crt and notified the crt of gauger right to of the kirstein assets,however,the crt reduced the nordwind parties award by half to.similarly,after certain artworks which were part of the kirstein assets were recovered and subsequently sold at an auction,the proceeds of the sale were distributed to the nordwind parties and gauger in equal shares.as a result of these awards and recovery of assets,and in accord with his retainer agreements,rowland received a contingent fee from gauger and,as well,a contingent fee from the nordwind parties in all actions in which rowland had represented them.
district court proceedings 
on december,the nordwind parties filed a complaint in the district court alleging various claims against the defendants related to rowland representation of the nordwind parties.the complaint,as later amended,included causes of action for negligence,legal malpractice,breach of fiduciary trust,breach of contract,and unjust enrichment.as a remedy,the complaint demanded compensatory and punitive damages in the amount of approximately million,disgorgement of all fees paid in connection with the case,disqualification of defendants from representing gauger,and an injunction against the defendants from representing gauger in the future with respect to her interest in the kirstein assets.following discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.
in a decision dated october,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed the nordwind parties complaint.nordwind,wl,at.after confirming diversity jurisdiction,pursuant to a,the district court concluded that the nordwind parties claims of breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,and negligence were duplicative of their claim for legal malpractice the nordwind parties claim for legal malpractice did not involve an actual injury because they would have received of the kirstein assets under the applicable german laws,regardless of whether gauger was represented by rowland or not and the nordwind parties unjust enrichment claim was without merit in light of the court dismissal of the underlying legal malpractice claim.id.at.the district court also denied the nordwind parties request to disqualify rowland.an amended judgment was entered on october,and a timely notice of appeal was filed on november.
on december,the parties stipulated to withdraw the appeal because some claims remain unadjudicated and no.b certification has been granted.on may,the district court issued a memorandum and order stating that the october,judgment was final under because all claims by then had been finally resolved.the appeal was thereafter reinstated on may.
on appeal,the nordwind parties argue principally that the district court erred in holding that,as a matter of german law,the nordwind parties were entitled only to of the kirstein assets in dismissing the nordwind parties claim of breach of fiduciary duty on the finding that it was duplicative of their claim for legal malpractice and in dismissing all of the nordwind parties claims based on the finding that the nordwind parties could not,as a matter of law,demonstrate that they would have prevailed on their legal malpractice claim.the nordwind parties also contend that the district court abused its discretion in denying their request to disqualify rowland from further representing gauger in relation to any claim to the kirstein assets.

legal malpractice 
in a diversity action based on attorney malpractice,state substantive law,here that of new york,applies.rubens mason,cir.to prevail on a claim for legal malpractice under new york law,a plaintiff must establish attorney negligence which is the proximate cause of a loss and actual damages.achtman kirby,mcinerney squire,llp,cir.we limit our discussion to the dispositive element of actual damages,which was determined by the district court to be lacking in this case as a matter of law.see nordwind,wl,at see also achtman,at.
according to the district court,the german property act operates to grant the nordwind parties and gauger rights to the kirstein assets in equal shares.relying upon this initial understanding of german law,the district court reasoned that because gauger had always been entitled to of the kirstein assets,whatever malpractice that attended rowland dual representation of the nordwind parties and gauger had no effect,caused no actual injury,on the nordwind parties right to the other of the kirstein assets.we agree with the district court interpretation of german law and,accordingly,the court reasons for finding that the nordwind parties suffered no actual injury in this case.
the german property act grants restitution rights to owners or their legal successors for property illegally confiscated by the nazi government.see vermögensgesetz vermg settlement of pending property claims,bundesgesetzblatt,teil i,translated.the right to restitution under the german property act vests directly in the property owner on september,date of the enactment of the german property act.in the event the owner has died prior to september,the restitution right directly vests in the owner legal successors.beck brief commentaries,palandt bürgerliches gesetzbuch ed.if the party originally affected by the illegal confiscation is no longer alive on the key date,september,his legal successor shall be the rightful claimant within the meaning of the german property act.translated.this is because the illegal confiscation measures,which the german property act addresses,were effective in rem,and,therefore,in cases of death of the owner of the confiscated property before the enactment of the property law,the confiscated asset was neither part of the estate under testate nor intestate succession.bundesverwaltungsgericht bverwg federal administrative court,bverwg viz,b berlin the english will case.
with respect to the determination of legal successor,german law generally provides that legal succession by inheritance is governed by the law of the state of which the testator has been a national at the time of his death.beck brief commentaries,palandt bürgerliches gesetzbuch eg ed translated.in the context of the german property act,however,german law dictates the determination of legal successor without the usual deference to local succession laws.see english will case,bverwg b t he concept of legal succession under the german property act can not be contingent on the question to whom the pertinent law of succession allocates the confiscated asset or the restitution claim the determination of legal successor is removed from the realm of law of succession.because the purpose of the german property act is to compensate for the illegal situation created by the expropriation and to the extent possible restore the status quo ante,the term legal successor has been defined specifically as those persons who ultimately would have inherited the property had it not been illegally confiscated.id.a ccording to the meaning and purpose of of the german property act,the person of the legal successor has to be determined without regard to the confiscation measure subject to the compensation.to this end,german law refers to the universal heir or its equivalent,see bürgerliches gesetzbuch bgb civil code,defining u niversal succession as the passing of the decedent assets as a whole to one or several other persons,as the legal successor who would have hypothetically inherited the illegally confiscated property,see,english will case,bverwg b.since the beneficiaries named in the residuary clause of a new york will inherit everything in the estate that is not subject to a specific bequest,these beneficiaries are regarded as the universal heirs for purposes of german law.id.
the german civil code adds an additional layer of analysis to the definition of legal successor by specifying that o nly a person who is living at the time of the accrual of the inheritance may become an heir.the german civil code,at simon goren,fred rothman.this provision is consistent with the german property act,which,as explained above,requires that the restitution rights vest directly in the property owner if he or she were not deceased prior to the enactment of the german property act,or requires that the restitution rights vest directly in the property owner legal successors if the property owner had been deceased prior to the enactment of the german property act.see bundesverwaltungsgericht bverwg federal administrative court,bverwg viz,c vg leipzig the farmer case.implied in this formula is that legal successors must be alive at the time the restitution rights vest.because the german property act requires the identification of those in whom the restitution rights will initially vest,the requirement that the legal successor be alive is a reasonable one that is consistent with the german civil code.indeed,although the nordwind parties misread section of the german civil code,see supra note,they do not contest its applicability to the german property act.see,expert opinion of stephen scherer,submitted by the nordwind parties relying on section of the german civil code.
in sum,then,legal successors under the german property act are those who were alive at the time of enactment of the german property act on september,and who hypothetically would have inherited the illegally confiscated property by virtue of having inherited all assets which were not specifically bequeathed from the relevant estate s.accord farmer case,bverwg c the legal succession concept as cited in the german property act addresses events of succession that have arisen until the german property act came into force on september,the law thus allows for the circumstance that the asset,had it not been confiscated from the injured party would have been transferred to the intestate or testate heir.emphasis added.
applying this framework,we conclude that the district court properly identified gauger as the putative owner of the kirstein assets.gauger,who was alive as of september,would have inherited of the kirstein assets from godfrey jacobsen,who died in and named gauger as the residual beneficiary of his estate.godfrey jacobsen would have inherited of the kirstein assets from his father,erich jacobsen,who died in and named godfrey jacobsen as the residual beneficiary of his estate.erich jacobsen would have inherited of the kirstein assets from his wife,gabrielle,who died in and left her entire estate to erich jacobsen.gabrielle,in turn,would have inherited of the kirstein assets from her mother,clara kirstein,who died in and left the kirstein assets to gabrielle and marianna in equal shares.
similarly,we conclude that the district court properly identified the nordwind parties as the putative owner of the remaining of the kirstein assets.the nordwind parties were assigned of the kirstein assets from miriam baer and the oriental institute.miriam baer,who was alive as of september,would have inherited of the kirstein assets from klaus baer,who died in and left his entire estate to his wife miriam baer for her lifetime with the remainder to the oriental institute.klaus baer would have inherited of the kirstein assets from his mother marianna,who died in and left her entire estate to klaus baer.marianna,in turn,would have inherited of the kirstein assets from her mother,clara kirstein,who died in and left the kirstein assets to gabrielle and marianna in equal shares.
we note that the arguments made by the nordwind parties are refuted by our interpretation of german law.for instance,the nordwind parties contentions that clara kirstein direct heirs,her daughters marianna and gabrielle,are the legal successors of clara kirstein under the german property act and that the restitution rights directly vested in marianna and gabrielle respective estates on september,is contrary to german law that limits heirs to living persons at the time of the accrual of the inheritance.because the confiscation of kirstein assets had in rem effect,clara kirstein could not her daughters could not restitution rights to the confiscated property until september,when those rights were created by the german property act.by the time the german property act was enacted,of course,marianna and gabrielle had long since passed away.
the nordwind parties also argue that gauger could not have inherited the kirstein assets under new york law because property not owned by the testator at the time of his death is not subject to disposition by will.shaw family archives cmg worldwide,d.relying upon this new york rule,the nordwind parties assert that gauger could not have inherited gabrielle interest in the kirstein assets by will because such interest did not exist until september,after all persons preceding gauger chain of inheritance had already died.this reliance on new york law is misplaced,however,as new york it may supplement the finding of legal successor insofar as new york wills are not affect the analysis in identifying the legal successor under german law.indeed,the nordwind parties assertion that local succession laws determine the identity of the legal successor is inconsistent with the german administrative court decision in the english will case.in the english will case,the decedent died in england fifteen years prior to the enactment of the german property act.although english law,like new york law,did not permit a decedent to bequeath property that did not exist at the time of his death,the german administrative court held that the testamentary not the intestate the legal successor to the restitution rights pursuant to the german property act.see english will case,bverwg b.thus,whether gauger would in fact have inherited the property under new york state law of intestate succession is irrelevant in determining the identity of the legal successor under the german property act.
accordingly,because gauger and the nordwind parties are both entitled to of the restitution rights to the kirstein assets,we hold that the nordwind parties are unable to establish,as a matter of law,that they suffered any injury when they and gauger each received of the kirstein assets through rowland dual representation.
breach of fiduciary duty 
the nordwind parties also argue that the district court erred in dismissing their breach of fiduciary duty claim as duplicative of their legal malpractice claim.we disagree because we conclude,as did the district court,that the breach of fiduciary duty claim that plaintiffs combined in the first cause of action with their legal malpractice claim must be dismissed as duplicative of the malpractice claim.
under new york law,where a claim for breach of fiduciary duty is premised on the same facts and seeking the identical relief as a claim for legal malpractice,the claim for fiduciary duty is redundant and should be dismissed.weil,gotshal manges,llp fashion boutique of short hills.however,if the remedy sought by the plaintiffs is a restitutionary one to prevent the fiduciary unjust enrichment,the less stringent substantial factor standard would apply to the causation element of the claim for breach of fiduciary duty.see lnc,first fidelity bank,cir sotomayor,see also,rsl commc ns plc bildirici,d,wl,at.otherwise,where damages are sought for breach of fiduciary duty under new york law,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant conduct proximately caused injury in order to establish liability.lnc,at achtman,at requiring standard to establish legal malpractice claim.
here,combined in their first cause of action,the nordwind parties do not dispute that their claims for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty seek identical relief for damages.instead,the nordwind parties initially argue that their legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty claims are not redundant because those claims are premised on different facts.they assert that their legal malpractice claim is based on rowland rendering erroneous legal advice to,that the nordwind parties and gauger were both entitled to of the kirstein his meeting with gauger.by contrast,they assert that their claim of breach of fiduciary duty is based on rowland dual representation of adverse,those alleged competing interests held by the nordwind parties and event that occurred after rowland meeting with gauger.we find these distinctions to be trivial.the nordwind parties legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty claims are factually inseparable in this case.
to establish an actionable claim for legal malpractice,the nordwind parties argue that rowland erroneously interpreted the law and committed malpractice by advising the nordwind parties that gauger was entitled to of the kirstein assets rowland acted on his erroneous interpretation of the law by representing gauger and rowland representation of gauger caused actual injury,the nordwind parties were identified as only rather than putative owners of the kirstein assets.to establish an actionable claim for breach of fiduciary duty,the nordwind parties argue that rowland representation of gauger caused rowland to be less faithful in protecting the nordwind parties rights to the entirety of the kirstein assets.presumed in the breach of fiduciary duty claim is that rowland understanding of the the nordwind parties and gauger each held interests to of the kirstein erroneous otherwise,there would be no viable breach of fiduciary duty claim in this case had rowland not represented adverse interests and failed in his obligation of undivided loyalty.see,fashion boutique of short hills,at.
it is evident that the nordwind parties malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty claims arise from the same three successive factual events rowland communication of legal advice regarding the identity of heirs to the kirstein assets rowland dual representation of the nordwind parties and gauger and the distribution of awards to the nordwind parties and gauger in equal shares.the nordwind parties temporal distinctions merely amount to identifying one of these factual events as different from another.their argument fails because all three of these factual events are at the core of both the malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty claims.
the nordwind parties next argue that their legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty claims are not redundant because different standards of causation apply to the two claims.although the nordwind parties erroneously argue that a legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty claim can never be redundant,they are correct in recognizing that new york law applies the lower substantial factor standard of causation to a breach of fiduciary duty claim for which the remedy of restitution is sought.the district court,in rejecting plaintiffs argument,reasoned that new york law does not differentiate between the causation standards for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty in the context of attorney liability.although the reasoning by which the district court rejected plaintiffs argument was incorrect,see lnc,at,we,too,reject that argument.the nordwind parties sought damages,and not restitution,as a remedy for the breach of fiduciary duty claim they stated as part of their first cause of action.therefore,the district court did not err in dismissing that claim for redundancy.the nordwind parties also brought,as part of their second cause of action,an unjust enrichment claim that is,in some respects,duplicative of the breach of fiduciary duty claim that they brought as part of their first cause of action.however,for this unjust enrichment claim the nordwind parties sought a restitutionary remedy rather than damages.the district court did not dismiss the nordwind parties unjust enrichment claim as redundant but instead denied relief after considering the claim on the merits.see infra part ii d unjust enrichment.
unjust enrichment 
the nordwind parties challenge the district court denial of their claim for unjust enrichment,for which they also seek the remedy of restitution.specifically,the nordwind parties argue that all compensation paid to rowland during his period of disloyalty to them must be disgorge d,irrespective of proof of damages.having concluded as a matter of law that the nordwind parties received the entire amount of their share of the kirstein assets to which they were entitled,we necessarily conclude that the breach of fiduciary duty claim that the nordwind parties included within their unjust enrichment claim fails because they were unable to show that they were injured by any alleged breach of fiduciary duty.further,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relief on the remainder of the nordwind parties unjust enrichment claim.
under new york law,a plaintiff may prevail on a claim for unjust enrichment by demonstrating that the defendant benefitted at the plaintiff expense and that equity and good conscience require restitution.beth israel med,at internal quotation marks omitted.the main thrust of the nordwind parties argument is that equity compels an award of restitution because rowland used information he received from representing the nordwind parties to advocate the interests of a party who holds competing interests.the nordwind
