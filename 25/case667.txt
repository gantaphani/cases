novo nordisk pharmaceuticals,and novo nordisk collectively,novo appeal from the final judgment of the united states district court for the district of delaware in their suit for patent infringement against general and teva pharmaceuticals usa.the district court held the two claims of novo nordisk patent the patent invalid by reason of anticipation under a.the court also held the patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.novo nordisk,wl,opinion.we affirm the judgment of invalidity with respect to claim of the patent,as well as the judgment that the patent is unenforceable.we vacate the judgment of invalidity with respect to claim of the patent.
background 
novo nordisk pharmaceuticals,and novo nordisk are pharmaceutical manufacturers.novo nordisk is the assignee of the patent,which is entitled biosynthetic human growth hormone.the patent is directed to a process for producing ripe human growth hormone hgh protein in bacteria through the use of recombinant dna techniques.novo nordisk pharmaceuticals,is the healthcare affiliate of novo nordisk.
the hgh protein has a specific sequence of amino acids and is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland.the protein,which plays a central role in cell growth and metabolism,is therapeutically useful to treat,among other conditions,growth hormone deficiencies and infertility.it also is useful in wound care.until the,hgh for therapeutic purposes could be obtained only from the pituitary gland of a human cadaver known as hgh.however,the use of hgh carried a high risk of contamination and infection for the patient.
prior to the patent,numerous attempts were made to produce biosynthetic hgh that would function in vivo in the same manner as hgh.one such attempt,set forth in patent,resulted in hgh protein with amino acids,instead of the amino acids found in hgh.patent,ll.the additional amino acid residue,methionine,resulted in a hgh protein variant that does not function in the same way in vivo as hgh.accordingly,there was a need for a method to produce pure hgh,or hgh containing the amino acid sequence identical to that of hgh.
as noted,the patent discloses the production of ripe hgh protein via recombinant dna techniques.recombinant dna techniques make it possible to transfer dna segments genes that code for a human protein to bacteria,such as coli,for the purpose of protein synthesis.
bacteria such as coli normally will not recognize a human gene sequence and,thus,will not synthesize the corresponding human protein.however,transferring the gene sequence for a fusion protein into coli,in effect,tricks the bacteria into synthesizing the human protein.the gene sequence for the fusion protein contains,in a relationship the gene sequence for a bacterial protein and the gene sequence for a human protein,such as hgh.the coli recognizes the portion of the gene sequence that encodes the bacterial protein and,as a result,synthesizes the entire fusion protein.the fusion protein is made up of the amino acid sequence for the bacterial protein and the amino acid sequence for the human protein.in order to isolate the desired human protein,the bacterial amino acid sequence,or,must be removed from the fusion protein.this process can be accomplished through the use of a proteolytic enzyme the proteolytic enzyme cleaves the bond between the and the amino acid sequence for the human protein.
the patent discloses a process whereby a proteolytic enzyme,preferably the enzyme dipeptidyl aminopeptidase i dap i,cleaves a fusion protein in order to produce ripe hgh protein.patent.first,the gene sequence for the hgh protein is combined with the gene sequence for a bacterial protein.id,ll.this dna sequence is then introduced into coli.id,ll.this results in a fusion protein being produced by the coli bacteria.the resulting fusion protein is made up of the sequence for the hgh protein and a variable amino acid sequence with an even number of amino acids that is formulated to take advantage of the cleavage specificity of dap i.when dap i is then added,it works to cleave,or cut,the fusion protein at the junction of the two amino acid sequences described above.id,ll.this results in ripe hgh protein,or hgh protein containing the correct amino acid sequence.
the patent traces priority back through a series of continuation applications to application ser,filed on december,as pct application the pct application.the pct application,in turn,traces priority back to a danish patent application filed on december.the pct application was directed to a process for preparing ripe proteins from fusion proteins,synthesized in pro or eukaryotic cells.unlike the patent,which discloses the use of the proteolytic enzyme dap i,the pct application discloses leucine aminopeptidase lap as the preferred cleavage enzyme to produce ripe hgh protein from a fusion protein.
on november,novo filed application the application,directed to a process for preparing a desired protein.the application discloses a process for producing hgh protein from a fusion protein using the dap i enzyme.the application was the first in a series of applications that claimed a priority date of december,based on the pct application.the final application in the chain was application ser.the application,filed on march.the patent issued from the application on may.
the patent has two claims 
biosynthetic ripe human growth hormone free of contaminants from pituitary derived human growth hormone.
biosynthetic ripe human growth hormone produced by expressing an amino terminal extended human growth hormone fusion protein in a microorganism capable of such expression,enzymatically cleaving the amino terminal extension and recovering the biosynthetically produced ripe human growth hormone.
on july,the board of patent appeals and interferences board of the united states patent and trademark office pto declared an interference involving novo patent and general application ser.the application.blumberg dalbøge,interference.march,board decision.the application is directed to a biosynthetic hgh protein produced via recombinant dna techniques.in declaring the interference,the board accorded the patent the benefit of priority of the august,filing date of patent application ser.the application 
in due course,novo filed a preliminary motion in the interference seeking the benefit,for purposes of priority,of the filing date of the pct application.board opinion,slip op.at.general,in turn,moved to deny novo the benefit of the filing date of the pct application,as well as the benefit of the filing date of the application.it argued that dap i was not disclosed in the pct application,and that the lap enzyme that was disclosed in the application was not effective to produce ripe hgh protein.board decision,slip op.at.
on march,the board issued its final decision,awarding priority to novo.the board noted that during prosecution of its applications resulting in the patent,novo had made contradictory statements regarding whether the pct application enabled the production of ripe hgh protein.however,the board concluded w e do not find the evidence relied upon by general to establish that pure lap would not work to produce ripe hgh in the methods described in the and pct applications to be convincing.board decision,slip op.at.
on april,pursuant to,general appealed the final decision of the board to the united states district court for the district of delaware.the district court eventually reversed the board decision awarding novo priority with respect to the invention claimed in the patent.novo nordisk,slip op.at,wl,priority decision.in doing so,the court ruled that the pct application was not enabled because one of ordinary skill in the art would not have been able to produce ripe hgh protein at the time the application was filed using the information disclosed in the application.id.at.the court based this determination,in part,on a finding that novo itself had been unable to synthesize ripe hgh protein using the disclosure of the pct application.id.at.the court remanded the case to the board for consideration of two preliminary motions by novo that the board had dismissed as moot 
on april,novo filed a complaint in the district of delaware against general and teva pharmaceuticals usa,collectively,for infringement of the patent and for injunctive relief to prevent the sale of,a recombinant hgh protein product on june,the district court issued a preliminary injunction,which was vacated by this court on november.novo nordisk.on june,filed its answer to the complaint and asserted a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid and unenforceable.
prior to trial,admitted infringement of claim of the patent.opinion,slip op.at.thereafter,from august,to august,the district court construed the claims of the patent and held a bench trial on the issues of invalidity of claim of the patent by reason of anticipation and unenforceability of the patent due to inequitable conduct.
following the trial,the district court found that claim of the patent was anticipated by a december article by george pavlakis,published in the journal biochemistry and entitled expression of two human growth hormone genes in monkey cells infected by simian virus recombinants the pavlakis article.opinion,slip op.at.based upon that finding,the court ruled claims and invalid under a.id.in addition,the court held that the patent was unenforceable based on inequitable conduct during prosecution of the application and during the interference proceeding before the board.id.
novo now appeals the district court decision.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review a district court decision following a bench trial for errors of law and clearly erroneous findings of fact.smithkline beecham apotex,citing allen eng g bartell.a factual finding is clearly erroneous when,although there is evidence to support the finding,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.tegal tokyo electron,quoting united states united states gypsum.however,w here the record viewed in its entirety renders the district court account of the evidence plausible or discloses two permissible readings of the evidence,the has committed no clear error.king instruments perego,citation omitted.
on appeal,novo challenges the district court rulings with respect to both validity and inequitable conduct.we address its contentions in turn,starting with the validity issue.
as noted above,the district court ruled that the patent was invalid by reason of anticipation based upon the pavlakis article.in the article,pavlakis describes a method of producing hgh protein with monkey kidney cells using what is known as the secretion approach the article discusses using the secretion approach with two different hgh genes,identified as and.the gene encodes for the amino acid sequence of hgh.the gene is a variant of the gene,containing fourteen amino acid substitutions.the article describes a variety of tests performed on the two resulting proteins,using gel electrophoresis isoelectric focusing and nonequilibrium ph gradient electrophoretic gels and cell surface receptor binding studies involving culture human lymphocytes and pregnant rabbit liver membranes based on these tests,pavlakis comes to the conclusion that the protein,as predicted from the dna sequence,appears identical in all respects to the major form of pituitary hgh.in contrast,the protein differs from authentic hgh both in its behavior on isoelectric focusing gels and in its low immunoreactivity,yet it binds to hgh receptors quite efficiently.
in its anticipation analysis,the district court construed the term ripe hgh in claim of the patent to mean a protein produced by recombinant dna techniques composed of a amino acid sequence identical to that of hgh produced by the human pituitary gland with the full biological activity of hgh produced by the human pituitary gland,and free of the contaminants present in hgh produced by the human pituitary gland.opinion,slip op.at.the court determined that the pavlakis article discloses each limitation of claim of the patent.id.at.the court stated 
first,the pavlakis article describes a method to produce hgh using recombinant dna techniques.second,the pavlakis article specifically discusses experimental tests used to characterize the hgh product.gel electrophoresis,isoelectric focusing,and nonequilibrium ph gradient electrophoresis analyses all revealed that the hgh product was indistinguishable from hgh this collective data establishes that the hgh product necessarily must be composed of the same amino acid residues as the hgh.third,the pavlakis article discloses through receptor binding assay data that the product exhibited the same receptor binding affinity as hgh in both the human lymphocyte line and the pregnant rabbit liver membranes.from this,the court concludes that the product has the full biological activity of hgh produced by the human pituitary gland.finally,the aforementioned data inherently establishes that the hgh product is free of contaminants present in hgh produced by the human pituitary gland.accordingly,the court concludes that the pavlakis article clearly and convincingly discloses all of the limitations of claim of the patent.
id.at.the court also determined that the pavlakis article was enabled.id.
on appeal,novo argues that the pavlakis article can not anticipate claim of the patent because the article does not disclose the second and third limitations of the claim a protein that is composed of a acid sequence identical to that of hgh and that has the full biological activity of hgh.novo argues that the test results disclosed in the article do not demonstrate conclusively that the protein discussed is identical in these respects to hgh.
novo also argues that the district court committed reversible error when it stated that p rior art references are presumed to be enabling,opinion,slip op.at,given that the pavlakis article is a publication.novo acknowledges our decision in amgen hoechst marion roussel,in which we held that a presumption arises that both the claimed and unclaimed disclosures in a prior art patent are enabled,but in which we did not decide whether the presumption applies to publications.see id.at we note that by logical extension,our reasoning here might also apply to prior art printed publications as well,but as sugimoto is a patent we need not and do not so decide today.novo argues that,in the case of a prior art reference,however,the burden of proving enablement of the prior art reference by clear and convincing evidence should remain on an alleged infringer.
responds that the district court correctly determined that the pavlakis article discloses each limitation of claim.also argues that the district court correctly held that the pavlakis article is presumed to be enabled.lastly,urges that even if the article is not presumptively enabled,the district court held on separate grounds that it enabled the subject matter of claim.
a patent claim is invalid by reason of anticipation if the invention was known or used by others in this country,or patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country,before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent a.anticipation based on a printed publication under section a requires the presence in the publication of each and every limitation of the claimed invention.advanced display,kent state,citation omitted.however,a prior art reference may anticipate without disclosing a feature of the claimed invention if that missing feature is necessarily present,or inherent,in the single anticipating reference.smithkline beecham,at quoting schering geneva.what a prior art reference discloses in an anticipation analysis is a factual determination that we review under the clearly erroneous standard.tegal,at citing in re graves.
in order to anticipate,a prior art disclosure must also be enabling,such that one of ordinary skill in the art could practice the invention without undue experimentation.smithkline beecham,at.the standard for enablement of a prior art reference for purposes of anticipation under section differs from the enablement standard under.rasmusson smithkline beecham,citation omitted.while section provides that the specification must enable one skilled in the art to use the invention,id.quoting in re hafner,section makes no such requirement as to an anticipatory disclosure,id.significantly,we have stated that anticipation does not require actual performance of suggestions in a disclosure.rather,anticipation only requires that those suggestions be enabled to one of skill in the art.squibb ben venue,citing in re donohue,it is not,however,necessary that an invention disclosed in a publication shall have actually been made in order to satisfy the enablement requirement.whether a prior art reference is enabling is a question of law based upon underlying factual findings.smithkline beecham,at citation omitted.
we see no error in the district court finding that the pavlakis article discloses the second and third limitations of claim of the patent.these limitations require that the hgh protein be composed of a acid sequence identical to that of hgh and that the protein have the full biological activity of hgh.in that regard,the article states that t he protein,as predicted from the dna sequence,appears identical in all respects to the major form of pituitary hgh.emphasis added.further,the article discusses experimental tests used to characterize the hgh product.these tests were designed in order to determine whether the protein had the same amino acid sequence and biological activity as hgh.the article discussion of the tests provides strong support for the district court conclusion that the pavlakis article discloses the subject matter of claim.gel electrophoresis tests reported in the article demonstrated that the protein with hgh on the gel and that thus was of the same overall size as hgh.at the same time,the results from tests using isoelectric focusing and nonequilibrium ph gradient electrophoresis gels showed that the protein with hgh on a ph gradient and that it thus had the same charge as hgh.finally,the results of radioreceptor assays with both the human lymphocyte line and pregnant rabbit liver membranes showed that was indistinguishable from hgh,indicating that had an identical ability to bind to cell surface receptors.thus,the test results disclosed in the pavlakis article indicated that the protein had the same structure and chemical properties as hgh.in other words,the test results indicated that the protein contained the same amino acid sequence and biological activity as hgh.accordingly,we hold that the article discloses a ripe hgh protein.
as far as enablement is concerned,in our view,a fair reading of the district court opinion is that the court did not rely solely on the amgen presumption in finding that the pavlakis article was enabled.see koito,at trial,the declaratory judgment plaintiff potential infringer failed to provide any testimony or other evidence that would demonstrate how that reference jp,a japanese unexamined application met the limitations of the claim in the patent or how the reference enabled one of ordinary skill in the art to practice the claimed invention.in that regard,the court determined that affirmatively established enablement of the pavlakis article.the court stated 
moreover,the pavlakis article offers particular materials and methodology to produce hgh.the court has no reason to doubt that this information will not lead to the successful production of hgh.indeed,pavlakis actually made the subject matter of claim using the disclosed materials and methodology set forth in the pavlakis article.
opinion,slip op.at.
the critical inquiry is whether the pavlakis article discloses in an enabling manner the production of ripe hgh.see smithkline,at thus,whether it was actually possible to make pure pch anhydrate before the critical date of the patent is irrelevant.the patent suffices as an anticipatory prior art reference if it discloses in an enabling manner the production of phc hemihydrate.see also rasmusson,at squibb,at in re donohue,at.the pavlakis article discloses the production of ripe hgh protein in an enabling manner because it discusses particular materials and a particular methodology the secretion approach to produce the hgh protein.in other words,the article relies on standard recombinant dna techniques that would have been understood by one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of its publication.we see no reason to disturb the district court conclusion that the pavlakis article is sufficiently enabling to serve as an anticipating reference.we therefore affirm the district court ruling that claim of the patent is anticipated by the pavlakis article 
the district court order,dated august,states that the patent is invalid under.however,as novo points out,the validity of claim was not litigated at trial.accordingly,we vacate the portion of the district court order relating to claim of the patent.
we turn next to novo argument that the district court erred in holding the patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct during prosecution of the application and during the interference proceedings before the board.the following additional facts relating to prosecution of the application are relevant to the inequitable conduct issue 
as noted above,the patent claims priority based on the pct application.the pct application,in turn,claims priority to the danish patent application filed on december.
the pct application discloses the use of the lap enzyme to produce ripe hgh from a fusion protein.example of the application describes the production,purification,and evaluation of a fusion protein.it also describes treatment of the fusion protein with the lap enzyme in order to obtain ripe hgh.finally,example states that standard tests indicated that the disclosed methodology produced ripe hgh protein that was pure.speaking in the past tense,the example states that t he fusion product was purified from this extract,pct application at emphasis added,that t he purified fusion protein was evaluated to be more than pure,id.emphasis added,and that t his product was then treated with leucine aminopeptidase,id.emphasis added.
the district court found,however,and it is undisputed,that when the pct application was filed on december,the inventors had not successfully prepared hgh with lap using recombinant dna technology.priority decision,slip op.at.for five months after the pct application was filed,novo scientists attempted unsuccessfully to use lap enzyme to synthesize hgh.finally,on march,novo successfully synthesized hgh using commercial lap purchased from a company called sigma.id.at.however,unbeknownst to novo at the time,the particular batch of lap contained the dap i enzyme.id.at.at a meeting on october,novo scientists concluded that the active component in sigma lap presumably is not lap but a contaminating substance.id.at.the discovery that this contaminating substance was dap i led to the filing,on february,of the pct application.the pct application,entitled a process for producing human growth hormone,disclosed a process for producing hgh from a fusion protein using the dap i enzyme.id.
on october,novo filed patent application ser.the application,entitled process for producing human growth hormone.priority decision,slip op.at.the application did not claim priority to the pct application,but instead claimed priority to the pct application.during prosecution of the application,the originally filed claims were rejected under as obvious over patent to in view of patent to daum on april,in a response to a final rejection,novo argued that the daum patent was distinguishable from the invention in the application.novo stated 
daum mentions that with lap it is possible to split off methionine from foreign proteins.
although applicants have tested lap with bacterially produced hgh,lap has been shown not to be effective.the effectiveness of lap seems to disappear as soon as peptides greater than about amino acids are involved.
emphasis in original.
in addition,on september,novo filed a declaration on behalf of jorli ringsted,john pendersen,and thorkild christensen,all of whom are named inventors on the patent the declaration.the declaration described the ability of the lap enzyme to remove a from a fusion protein to produce hgh.after describing an experiment in which the scientists compared lap preparations from several different suppliers,the inventors stated 
it is shown that essentially only from sigma contain enzymatic activity able to convert to mature hgh.from merck,serva,and worthington did not contain such enzymatic activity at all.it is thus likely that an enzymatic activity different from is contained in the sigma preparations,which can convert to mature hgh.
the novo scientists went on to conclude 
the experiments show clearly that a pure will not convert amino extended hgh to mature hgh.only with relevant impurities will have some effect depending upon the nature and amount of the impurity and of course this can lead to misunderstanding about the effect of lap.
thus,during prosecution of the application,novo sought to overcome the prior art rejection based upon daum by arguing that the lap enzyme disclosed in daum was not effective in the production of hgh protein.
unable to overcome the examiner rejections under section,novo eventually abandoned the application.over the next several years,novo filed a number of applications describing the use of the dap i enzyme to produce ripe hgh and claiming priority to the pct application.then,on november,novo filed the application,directed to a process for preparing a desired protein.as seen above,the application disclosed a process for producing hgh from a fusion protein using the dap i enzyme.in a preliminary amendment,filed on october,novo amended the specification of the application to indicate that the application was entitled to a priority date of december,based upon the pct application claiming priority back to the danish application.novo specifically pointed out that the december,priority date of the pct upon that application claim of priority to the priority date of the danish patent the priority date of the brewer patent.
the examiner did not immediately accept the new priority claim,and on september,rejected the two pending claims as obvious under in view of several references,including the brewer patent.on january,the examiner held a personal interview with cheryl agris,a novo patent attorney,poul eisten petterson,a novo patent advisor,and thorkild christensen and henrik dalbøge,two of the named inventors on the application.the examiner record indicates that the brewer patent was one of the prior art items that was discussed at the conference and states in relevant part the priority date should be.cheryl agris will point out where in priority documents the enablement is present.
novo followed up the interview with an amendment,on january,which addressed the issue of whether the pct application was enabled.the issue of whether the pct application was enabled was critical to the prosecution because,if the application was not enabled,novo would not be able to rely upon the application priority date to overcome the brewer patent.novo pointed to the pct application as providing the general concept of adding an extension with an aminopeptidase,and isolation of mature hgh.novo also pointed to example of the pct application as being specifically directed to hgh.novo was ultimately able to claim priority to the pct application.upon allowance,the examiner stated 
t he amendment of abandoned files to recite additional parent history places the effective filing date of the instant invention to december,and foreign priority to december.therefore,the brewer et reference,published september,does not appear to be prior art against the invention.
as seen,the patent issued on may,from the application,the final application in the chain of applications that resulted in the patent.

the district court based its finding of inequitable conduct with respect to prosecution of the application on novo failure to disclose to the pto that example of the pct application had never actually been performed.id.at.referring to example being worded in the past tense,the court found that novo did not alert the examiner that the cleavage and purification steps had not been performed or that the purity result was merely a prediction.id.the district court found the requirement of materiality satisfied because the examiner relied upon example in deciding whether the pct application enabled the invention of the application and thus was entitled to a priority date earlier than that of the brewer patent.id.
next,the court found the inequitable conduct intent requirement satisfied because novo,nine years after it first submitted example to the pto,knew or should have known that the examiner would have considered the fact that example contained prophetic data important in evaluating whether the application,the counterpart of the pct application,enabled the invention of the application,particularly in light of the fact that novo never successfully produced ripe hgh using the methodology described in example.priority decision,slip op.at.
the district court found inequitable conduct with respect to the interference proceedings before the board based again upon novo failure to inform the board that it was ultimately unable to produce ripe hgh using the methodology described in example of the pct application.priority decision,slip op.at.first,the district court found the materiality element satisfied because the board looked to example and reviewed expert testimony related to whether the steps described therein enabled one of ordinary skill in the art to produce ripe hgh.id.with respect to the intent element,the court noted that,before the board,novo presented extensive expert testimony from about example,knowing that example had never been successfully performed.the court found that novo knew or should have known that the board would consider both example and villa romaroff expert opinion material to the question of enablement,particularly since this question was the sole focus of the interference.id.at.moreover,the court found that following the interference proceeding,novo failed to offer any explanation for its silence,merely asserting that it was not required to provide the pto with a running update of its efforts to make hgh.id.
on appeal,novo argues that the district court finding that novo was unable to make ripe hgh according to the methodology of example is clearly erroneous.pointing to the experiment performed on march,during which novo used commercial grade lap enzyme purchased from the sigma company in order to produce ripe hgh,novo asserts that it was able to produce ripe hgh according to the methodology of example.thus,novo argues,because the methodology did work,there can be no culpable failure to say that it did not work.
the district court did not commit clear error in determining that novo was unable to make ripe hgh according to the methodology of example.it is undisputed that on march,novo unintentionally used lap from the sigma company which happened to be contaminated with dap priority decision,slip op.at.moreover,at oral argument,counsel for novo conceded that novo was never able to produce ripe hgh through the use of pure lap enzyme.example is directed to the production of ripe hgh through the use of lap enzyme.we are not prepared to accept the proposition that simply because fate interceded and novo scientists unintentionally used lap contaminated with dap i,novo produced ripe hgh according to the methodology of example.
novo also assigns error to the district court finding that novo acted with deceptive intent in failing to disclose the prophetic nature of example to the pto or the board.according to novo,the district court never made a finding that anyone had actual knowledge that example of the pct application was prophetic and that novo never successfully produced ripe hgh using the methodology described in example.specifically,novo contends that there is no evidence that christensen,the who wrote example,subsequently learned that the drafting of a prophetic example in the past tense was not a good procedure at the pto,or that he subsequently told any of novo attorneys that example was prophetic thus,novo asserts,because it is impossible to disclose the unknown,the district court finding of inequitable conduct is reversible error under fmc manitowoc,stating that an a pplicant must be chargeable with knowledge of the existence of the prior art or information,for it is impossible to disclose the unknown.novo also asserts that the district court finding of inequitable conduct amounts to a finding of misconduct based on an imputation of gross negligence,contrary to our holding in kingsdown medical consultants,hollister,we adopt the view that a finding that particular conduct amounts to gross negligence does not of itself justify an inference of intent to deceive the involved conduct,viewed in light of all the evidence,including evidence indicative of good faith,must indicate sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive.
responds that christensen was aware that example was prophetic,and because knowledge of the law is chargeable to the inventor,and inventors represented by counsel are presumed to know the law,the district court inference of deceptive intent was not clearly erroneous.see brasseler,stryker sales.
we agree with.it is undisputed that christensen was aware that example was prophetic and that novo never successfully produced ripe hgh through the use of pure lap enzyme.it also is undisputed that,during prosecution of the application,christensen was one of four novo representatives present during the january,interview with the examiner,during which one of the issues addressed was enablement of the pct application,of which the application was the counterpart.as noted,other representatives included novo patent attorney and patent advisor.thus,novo asks us to hold,on the one hand,that the failure of christensen and his to disclose the truth about example to novo attorneys absolves them of their duty to disclose this information to the pto or the board,because without their attorney consultation,they could not have known that this information was material.at the same time,novo asks us to hold that its counsel failure to disclose the truth about example to the pto or board is excused because the inventors failed to fully inform them of the details surrounding example.as we have done in similar situations in the past,we reject the circular logic of this request.see brasseler,at we refuse to pursue the circular logic of brasseler request and decline to carve out an exception to the inequitable conduct law to shield those guilty of inequitable conduct from responsibility for their actions.see also molins,at stating that the knowledge and actions of an applicant representatives are chargeable to the applicant citing fmc,at.accordingly,the district court correctly concluded that novo knew or should have known that the pto and the board would have considered the information relating to example important in evaluating whether the pct application was enabled.
finally,novo argues that the withheld information about example can not be material as a matter of law because it was cumulative of what was already before the examiner,or because it is less relevant than information about the example methodology that was disclosed.see regents of of cal.eli lilly,e ven where an applicant fails to disclose an otherwise material prior art reference,that failure will not support a finding of inequitable conduct if the reference is simply cumulative to other references,if the reference teaches no more than what a reasonable examiner would consider to be taught by the prior art already before the pto.citing scripps clinic research found.genentech,a reference that is simply cumulative to other references does not meet the threshold of materiality that is predicate to a holding of inequitable conduct.citation omitted.
in making this argument,novo points to the declaration,which it describes as showing that pure lap enzyme did not work,while commercial lap from sigma did work.however,the withheld information concerning example was not merely cumulative of information already before the examiner nor was the withheld information less relevant than information already before the examiner.first,the testing conditions in example of the pct application differ from the testing conditions used in the examples in the declaration.the declaration does not indicate that pure lap enzyme is not effective to produce ripe hgh under the methodology and testing conditions of example of the pct application.in addition,an inventor failed attempts to practice an invention are relevant evidence of.see ak steel sollac,g iven the specification teaching away from the subject matter that was eventually claimed and ak steel own failures to make and use the later claimed invention at the time of the application,the district court correctly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact relating to undue experimentation as it relates to enablement.enzo biochem,calgene,the court noted that the record is replete with the inventor own failed attempts to control the expression of other genes in prokaryotes or eukaryotes using antisense technology.we see no error in the district court finding that the withheld information concerning example was material.we therefore affirm the district court ruling that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.
conclusion 
in sum,we affirm the district court holding that claim of the patent is invalid based on anticipation under a,as well as its holding that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.however,we vacate the court ruling that claim of the patent is invalid based on anticipation under a.
