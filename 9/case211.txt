after mark jones repeatedly failed to pass an examination to receive a license required by his employer of all persons in that position,by a date of which he had many months notice,he requested for the first time that the date be extended due to his medical condition.when his employer declined,and jones declined to pursue an open alternate position at lesser pay,his employment ended on january.he then sued under both federal and state disability laws.see et.laws ch,et.the district court entered summary judgment for the employer.jones nationwide life ins,d.we affirm,bypassing the question of whether jones met the definition of disability and holding that the reasonable accommodation provisions of both statutes do not save his case.
undisputed factual background 
in an appeal from a grant of summary judgment,we review the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.mulero rodríguez ponte,cir.
jones has worked in the insurance industry since.in,his company became nationwide retirement solutions insurance agency,nrsia,which,as relevant to this appeal,became defendant nationwide life insurance company nli in 
at nli,jones in became a retirement program services director,a managerial and supervisory position.his tasks included increasing the number of clients in his region,maintaining client relationships,and supervising and coaching the retirement specialists who worked under him.the retirement specialists met with employees participating in deferred compensation plans to explain nrs retirement programs and to offer products and services.as of december,jones was supervising seven retirement specialists,and he was ultimately responsible for ensuring that they were successful.during the relevant time period,jones reported to brenda anderson,one of nli regional vice presidents.anderson,in turn,reported to stephen angelis,the vice president of sales.
in,jones was involved in a motorcycle accident,and as a result he developed brachial plexus palsy bpp.this condition causes chronic pain in jones left arm and has caused him to lose most of his use of that arm,resulting in atrophy that has made his left arm smaller than his right.he has since regularly taken painkillers to manage his condition.
in february,jones fell and broke his left shoulder.jones already had a fused left shoulder held together by metal plates,so it was difficult to treat his new injury.he underwent four surgeries during.jones doctor prescribed both morphine and oxycodone to manage the pain.during and,jones developed an infection relating to his surgeries,and in june he had another operation to treat the infection and remove hardware from a previous surgery.
jones continued working full time through these events,except for approximately nine weeks of approved medical leave surrounding his various surgeries.his physician letter dated august,sent to nli associate health services department,stated that as of july,jones was medically cleared to return to work from his final surgery,with no restrictions.at no time before december,did jones claim to be disabled or to require an accommodation to do his job.
on february,jones had received an informing him that in mid,nrs would begin to offer a new retirement product called the nrs managed account service,which the parties refer to as proaccount.the stated that relevant employees would have to become an investment advisor representative iar of nationwide investment services corporation nisc in order to sell and service proaccount.to obtain the iar certification required the employee to pass the series or licensing exam,a test administered by the financial industry regulatory authority finra.finra offers windows during which the exams are available and controls the intervals that a must wait between exams if he does not pass.after the first and second failures,the waiting period is thirty days after the third and later failures it increases to days.because of the finra licenses he already held,jones was eligible to take the series exam.jones had taken and failed the series exam once in,but that was unrelated to the proaccount product.
jones knew that passing the series exam would be a job requirement.there is some uncertainty as to whether the february,conveyed that requirement jones claims that he did not learn of the requirement until december,yet this is clearly incorrect on march,jones received an from kathleen nader,one of the company compliance officers,which stated because you have been identified as someone who will be working with proaccount,you are required to become registered as an iar.
the march,also noted that under nisc policy,employees have days to pass the exam from the date that their first window opens.attached to this was a copy of the iar registration policy and an acknowledgment form.recipients were asked to return the signed acknowledgment form within ten days.this was sent to over employees who worked with managed accounts.
nonetheless,jones did not return his form until may,a delay which,in turn,delayed his eligibility to take the exam.in,nli series window was open from april through august.jones was first eligible to take the exam on may.jones did not take the series exam at any point in.
nrs began offering the proaccount product to customers in jones region in the spring of.on february,jones received an informing him that a testing window would be open from february through june.jones did not schedule a testing date until late in the window,on june,and he did not sign up for a preparatory class.jones failed the exam he took on june.
on december,angelis,the vice president of sales,all sales personnel,including jones,to inform them that,effective january,passing the series or exam by the end of that year would be a condition of employment in the regions where proaccount was offered.employees had until december,to pass the exam,or they would face transfer or termination.this requirement was uniformly applied to existing employees.
the following day,anderson jones and reminded him that this will be critical to pass when your window opens.please begin studying now to work toward a successful completion.thus,jones,at the very least,had clear notice that passing the exam was a function of his job for over months,and over twelve months notice that if he did not pass it could cost him his job.
the next testing window opened on january.but jones did not take the exam until late february.again,he failed to take a preparatory class for this exam.jones took and failed the exam for a second time on february,
jones did not take a preparatory class until after this second failure,and even then,he missed one day of the class.anderson also encouraged jones to take time off to study before his third exam sitting.
jones was next eligible to take the exam on march,and his window was open until may.he did not take the exam again until april,over a month after he took the preparatory class.jones failed the april exam.because the april test was jones third failure,he had to wait at least days to take the test again.this meant that he would have only one more chance to take the exam before the deadline on december.
by this time,jones was the only program director who had not passed the series exam,and all of the retirement specialists who worked under jones had also passed.because jones did not have the license,anderson had to step into jones role to supervise proaccount duties for the retirement specialists on his team.anderson had to spend additional time overseeing jones team members and reporting back to nli home office with regard to proaccount sales.she also had to take responsibility for managing proaccount items in nli compliance database.further,jones was only permitted to talk to clients in general terms about proaccount and could not be involved in sales of the product,so anderson also had to take on some of jones client communication duties.jones could not assist his retirement specialists when they made proaccount sales,a task that was normally part of a program director training duties.in may,anderson reported to angelis that she had empowered paul bertrand,a senior retirement specialist on jones team,to coach other team members on proaccount,though bertrand could not recall whether he had done so.jones performance evaluation stated that his team was unable to operate at full capacity with regard to proaccount sales because the team was not fully series licensed.
after jones returned from medical leave following his june surgery,anderson,on her own initiative,asked the human resources department whether the medical leave jones had taken in june and july would require an extension of jones series testing window.she was told that it would not,because jones had already had multiple windows and testing opportunities before the surgery.anderson did not inquire further about jones medical condition because she understood that information to be confidential.at no time before december,did jones say anything to anderson about his medical condition affecting his ability to take and pass the series exam.
jones final testing window opened on october.he had an opportunity to take another preparatory class,but he testified that he did not recall doing so.jones again waited for almost two months before taking the exam for a fourth time on december.he again failed.
that same day,jones called anderson to inform her that he had failed the exam.in this conversation,he did not ask for any extension of time to take the exam again.anderson then notified angelis.
on december,anderson spoke to jones again and reiterated the company policy about the necessity of obtaining a series license.in this phone call,jones mentioned for the first time that he thought his medical condition had affected his ability to pass the exam.also for the first time,he raised the possibility of being granted more time to pass given his medical condition over the past year.anderson told jones that nli had given him plenty of opportunity to pass and that they would need to be equitable when december arrived.she also stated that nli might be able to offer him a position in maryland as a retirement specialist because that position did not require a series license.
facing a december expiration date for his period to have obtained a series license,jones angelis on december,and,for the first time,specifically requested an extension of time to complete the series requirement.he told angelis that his recent medical condition and resulting treatment impacted me more than i would care to admit.jones stated that his injury and its aggressive treatment,including high doses of morphine and oxycodone,had drastically hindered his academic ability by making him unable to concentrate on the exam material.he did not submit any information from his medical providers in support of these assertions.
jones also assured angelis that his health was improving overall and positive changes in his pain management treatment have been favorable.angelis responded by telling jones he would discuss the matter with anderson and other members of the senior leadership team.
shortly thereafter,angelis held a conference call with anderson and other team members in which they discussed jones extension request.the group considered whether the unsupported assertions about his medical condition that jones had provided in his supported his request for an extension,and they determined that it did not.on december,anderson called jones and informed him that he would not be granted an extension.she told him that the decision to apply the original deadline would stand because it was a consistent policy across the company.anderson again offered to assist him in finding another position within the company.
anderson memorialized this december conversation in a letter to jones dated january,which stated 
this is to provide a formal notification of our discussion last week.as previously communicated,a series license is required for your position.since you did not obtain this license by the december,deadline,you are no longer eligible to remain in the standard plans program director position.
the letter also stated that jones would be terminated on january,if he did not find another position within nli jones chose not to pursue the position in maryland because it offered a significantly lower salary and would require him to relocate.he interviewed for,but did not get,a position in connecticut.jones was unable to secure another position by january,and his employment was terminated.
on january,jones oxycodone prescription was increased from ten to fifteen milligrams.as of june,jones continued to take fifteen milligrams of oxycodone and sixty milligrams of morphine.
because of the waiting period to retake the exam after more than two failures,jones would not have been eligible to take the series exam again until june,almost five months after his termination date.
procedural background 
on october,jones filed a complaint in massachusetts superior court,alleging that nli,nrs,and nrsia had discriminated against him on the basis of handicap,failed to reasonably accommodate his handicap,and failed to engage in an interactive process regarding accommodation,all in violation of.laws ch.the defendants removed the case to the district of massachusetts on the grounds of diversity on november.at the same time,the defendants moved to dismiss nrsia as a defendant.jones did not object to the motion,and nrsia was dismissed on january.jones then amended his complaint against nli and nrs on february,to add a cause of action under the americans with disabilities act ada,et.
after discovery,on november,the defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court held a hearing on december.on march,the district court issued a memorandum and order granting defendants motion.jones,d at.the court concluded that jones had failed to make out a prima facie case of disability discrimination because he could not demonstrate that he suffered from a disability under either federal or massachusetts law,or that the accommodation he requested was reasonable,id.at.jones timely appealed this decision on march.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.roman potter,cir.we will uphold summary judgment where the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.we may affirm summary judgment on any basis apparent in the record.chiang verizon new eng,cir.
we analyze claims under the ada and under massachusetts general laws chapter using the same framework.ward.health research,cir.at times the two schemes may vary,but that is not at issue here.
under mcdonnell douglas green,d,a plaintiff in a disability discrimination case must first make out a prima facie case.ordinarily,the plaintiff must show that he is disabled within the meaning of the ada is qualified to perform the essential functions of his job with or without a reasonable accommodation and was discharged or otherwise adversely affected in whole or in part because of his disability.see richardson friendly ice cream,cir garcía ayala lederle parenterals,cir.we describe later the requirement for a plaintiff to show a failure to make a reasonable accommodation.
jones raises several challenges to the district court application of this standard.while jones attacks the conclusion that he was not disabled,we bypass that issue and turn to the qualified individual and reasonable accommodation prongs.we also bypass the question of whether the standards of the ada amendments act of,which affect the definition of disability,apply here under either standard,the claim fails.
as to the qualified individual element of his prima facie case,jones argues that the district court erred in implicitly finding that obtaining a series license was an essential function of jones job he then argues that,even if it was an essential function,he could have performed it with the reasonable accommodation of an extension of time,and the district court erred in finding his proposal unreasonable as a matter of law.we reject both arguments.
while we agree with jones that several of the facts stated in the district court opinion are mistaken,none of those facts is material to our analysis.
qualified individual 
the qualified individual criterion and the reasonable accommodation requirement are interrelated.perritt,americans with disabilities act handbook,at ed.being qualified is determined in relation to the essential functions of the job,and reasonable accommodation by the employer does not require the elimination of an essential function of the job.id.footnote omitted.
an essential function is a fundamental job duty of the position at issue.the term does not include marginal tasks,but may encompass individual or idiosyncratic characteristics of the job.kvorjak maine,cir citations omitted quoting ward,at.factors to be considered include the employer judgment,written job descriptions,the work experience of past incumbents of the job,and the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.mulloy acushnet,cir citing n.the court gives a significant degree of deference to an employer business judgment about the necessities of a job.jones walgreen,cir.
the employer,nli,indisputably characterized passing the series exam as an essential function of the job of program director in jones region.as early as march,and certainly no later than december,nli conveyed to jones and others that the series license was a job requirement with the introduction of proaccount.in particular,the december from angelis explicitly stated that a series license would be a condition of employment and that failure to pass the exam by the end of could result in termination.jones direct superior also repeatedly emphasized to him the importance of passing the series exam.the program director job description stated that a series license could be required for the job.by october,all of nli program directors in regions offering proaccount had obtained series licenses,except for jones.
jones makes much of the fact that the person nli hired to replace him did not have a series license when he was hired.but that does not show that having the license was not an essential function of the job.to the contrary,jones replacement was required to obtain the license,and he did in fact obtain it on june,less than six months after he was hired and within his first testing window.since jones was ineligible,due to his previous failures,to take the exam again until june,his successor in fact passed the exam before jones possibly could have.
we reject jones argument that because his team showed strong proaccount sales even when jones lacked the license,that means the license requirement was not an essential function.in the essential functions inquiry,t he fact that certain tasks associated with a particular position can be either reduced,reassigned,or reallocated does not,by itself,render them to the position they were associated to in the first place.walgreen,at.as a practical matter,jones himself admitted that because he had not passed the exam,anderson was forced to perform certain functions of jones job with regard to proaccount.this reinforces that obtaining the license was an essential function.
reasonable accommodation 
where a plaintiff alleges a failure to accommodate,the plaintiff must show that the employer knew about plaintiff disability and did not reasonably accommodate it.see freadman metro.prop.cas.ins,cir rocafort ibm,cir.jones attacks the district court conclusion that he did not meet his burden of showing that his purported accommodation request was reasonable.he argues that he could have performed the essential function of passing the series exam with the reasonable accommodation of an extension of time,and also that it was error for the district court to conclude that such an accommodation was unreasonable because it would have been futile.see jones,d at.
a plaintiff must explicitly request an accommodation,unless the employer otherwise knew one was needed.freadman,at.an accommodation request must be sufficiently direct and specific,and it must explain how the accommodation is linked to plaintiff disability.see also tobin liberty mut.ins,cir.the obligation is on the employee to provide sufficient information to put the employer on notice of the need for accommodation.lindemann grossman,employment discrimination law ch.iii,at ed citing o app.this means not only notice of a condition,but of a causal connection between the major life activity that is limited and the accommodation sought.id.ch,at quoting wood crown redi mix,cir internal quotation mark omitted.
jones only purported accommodation request was his sunday,december,to angelis.while this was direct and specific in its request for an extension of time,it did not link jones request to his disability.his briefing asserts that bpp was his disability.the states that jones underwent multiple surgeries and aggressive pain management treatment.it does not mention bpp or suggest in any way that jones recent medical treatments or pain therapy were connected to bpp.it does assert that t he seriousness of my medical condition coupled with the aggressive treatment which followed,left me intensely ill,physically,as well as it sic drastically hindered my academic ability as i was unable to successfully concentrate on the material during the previous exams.at the same time,the says that despite his medical challenges,jones had performed his job well during the last two years.jones did not refer to or attach any medical records or certifications in support of his statements.
nli executives were not on notice that the symptoms jones described in his were caused by a disability.see reed lepage bakeries,cir holding that plaintiff did not adequately request accommodation when she failed to inform superiors that her anger management problems were due to bipolar disorder,because she never adequately put the employer on notice of her disability,id.at,and gave no notice of the aspect of her illness relevant to the accommodation she sought,id.at.the employer was aware that during jones had been able to perform all other aspects of his job without any claim of impairment.indeed,before the assertions made on december,jones doctor had permitted jones to return to work with no limitations following his june surgery.whatever jones evident physical characteristics,they had neither been claimed earlier to have been a disability nor been claimed to have required an accommodation.
beyond that,jones requested accommodation was not reasonable.it was jones burden to demonstrate that his requested accommodation seem ed reasonable on its face.see airways,barnett,d citing reed,at.
to begin with,the request came too late and after jones knew his employment was being terminated after his failure to perform an essential function of his job.for two years,he had not had the capacity to handle a product his company was marketing.when an employee requests an accommodation for the first time only after it becomes clear that an adverse employment action is imminent,such a request can be too little,too late.reed,at see also rose laskey,cir per curiam finding that plaintiff presentation of therapist letter requesting leave of absence after plaintiff threatened supervisor with violence was untimely as well as unreasonable hill.city area transp,cir finding accommodation request untimely when employee made request only after committing two rule violations that she knew would mandate her discharge soileau guilford of,cir noting,in context of ada retaliation claim,the danger of permit ting an employee already on notice of performance problems to seek shelter in a belated claim of disability halpern wake forest.health,cir rejecting medical student claim that school failed to reasonably accommodate his mental illness,in part because student did not allege that his behavioral problems were manifestations of a disability until after disciplinary board had recommended his dismissal wynne tufts.sch.of,cir rejecting medical student claim that school failed to reasonably accommodate his learning disability,in part because student never requested alternative testing method until he had failed exam three times and faced expulsion.
second,in order to show that a proposed accommodation is reasonable,a plaintiff must demonstrate that it would enable him to perform the essential functions of his job and would be feasible for the employer under the circumstances.tobin,at quoting reed,at internal quotation mark omitted.jones can not satisfy the first prong of this test because he presented no basis to his employer for his claim that a delay beyond december,until he was eligible to take the exam again was reasonable.he also did not show any reason for the employer to conclude he would pass the exam if given yet another opportunity to take it.
one element in the reasonableness equation is the likelihood of success.evans fed.express,cir see also halpern,at t he indefinite duration and uncertain likelihood of success of plaintiff proposed accommodation renders it unreasonable.jakubowski christ,cir holding proposed accommodation unreasonable where plaintiff failed to show how proposal would allow him to overcome a key obstacle to performing an essential function.thus,in evans,this court held that an employer was not required to grant the plaintiff a second leave of absence for substance abuse treatment when plaintiff first round of treatment,for which he had been granted leave,ended in failure.evans,at.
jones attempts to distinguish his case from evans on the ground that jones had not formally requested any other accommodation before december.this is true,but misses the point.as in evans,past experience gave nli no reason to believe that allowing jones proposed accommodation would actually lead him to pass the series exam.nli had opened four testing windows since the february jones could have taken the exam six times.he did take it four times,and he failed each time.
the record also shows evidence of later events,which,while not known to the employer at the time,tends to support its conclusion.in his december,jones represented that his health situation was improving.in fact,jones doctor increased his oxycodone dosage just a month later.as of june,jones continued to take high doses of prescription pain medication.he later stated in a deposition that he might have sought a delay of up to a year before taking the test again.
jones did not satisfy his burden of showing facial reasonableness,see barnett,at,and thus we agree with the district court that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on jones claim for failure to accommodate,see jones,d at.
interactive process and disparate treatment 
finally,jones reasserts his claims for failure to engage in an interactive process and for disparate treatment,which the district court did not reach.both must fail.
jones disparate treatment claim fails because he did not establish that he was qualified to perform the essential functions of his job with or without a reasonable accommodation.
jones also can not sustain a claim that the employer failed to engage in an interactive process,for a number of reasons.a n employer duty to accommodate does not arise unless at a bare minimum the employee is able to perform the essential functions of his job with an accommodation.walgreen,at quoting decaro hasbro,cir internal quotation marks omitted.it was jones burden to proffer accommodations that were reasonable under the circumstances,id.at,and jones did not satisfy this burden.further,liability for failure to engage in an interactive process depends on a finding that,had a good faith interactive process occurred,the parties could have found a reasonable accommodation that would enable the disabled person to perform the job essential functions.kvorjak,at.jones did not present evidence to support such a conclusion.finally,the employer did raise the possibility of offering jones a transfer to another open position,but jones declined to pursue that option.
judgment for the employer is affirmed.
in the transition to nrsia,jones officially became an employee of nationwide retirement solutions,nrs,the other defendant named in this appeal.in,nrs ceased having payroll and employment functions,and all employees of that affiliate were transferred to nli.nrs continued to provide the products and services that nli employees the time relevant to this appeal,jones was employed by nli.nli and nrs argued before the district court that nrs should be dismissed as a party because it was not the employer during the relevant time period and jones had not articulated any separate theory of nrs liability.jones did not address this argument in his opposition to summary judgment.in its memorandum and order granting summary judgment,the district court stated in a footnote that the nationwide affiliates other than nli have been dismissed.jones nationwide life ins,d.however,the district court docket indicates that nrs was never formally dismissed.nrs thus remains a party to this appeal.we will treat the district court order as having granted summary judgment to nrs for the same reasons as those applicable to nli.
the job description for jones position indicated that a series license may be required.the february notified jones that passing the exam would be required to offer proaccount to clients,but it did not explicitly state that passing the exam was a job requirement.the february did contain information about the upcoming testing window,offer instructions about how to prepare for the test,and urge recipients to begin studying immediately and to schedule an exam as soon as possible once the window opened.
technically,this was the third time that jones failed the exam,counting his failure in.however,for the purpose of his waiting periods,the february test counted as only the second failure,since it was the second one after nli began opening windows related to proaccount certification in.
of the six other nli employees who had not met the series requirement by the december,deadline,three were terminated and three were transferred to other positions that did not require the series license.
the statutory definitions of disability under the ada and handicap under chapter are essentially the same.faiola apco graphics,cir.
under the ada,in order to establish that he is disabled,a plaintiff must show that he has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.a.in,the supreme court interpreted this language strictly.see toyota motor,williams,d.the ada amendments act of adaaa,pub,stat,however,rejected this strict standard and instructed that disability should be construed in favor of broad coverage.id.a codified at a.the adaaa was enacted on september,and became effective on january.the district court found that the adaaa did not apply to jones claims because the relevant conduct took place before january,and the adaaa does not apply retroactively to conduct occurring before its effective date.jones,d at citing thornton united parcel,cir.jones,on the other hand,argues that relevant conduct did occur after january,and further that the adaaa should apply retroactively to conduct taking place between the enactment date and the effective district court then concluded that,while jones had established that he suffered a physical impairment,this impairment did not severely restrict his ability to perform the major life activity of working.id.at.it also found that jones had not and could not have argued that he suffered from a mental disability that severely restricted him from working,considering that he continued to perform all functions of his job other than passing the series exam even while he was injured and taking painkillers.id.this analysis would hold,the court noted,even under the more generous adaaa standard.id.at.jones argues that the court misinterpreted the disability standard.he asserts that his bpp is a disability because it severely impairs all of the major life activities that require use of his left arm,and it did not have to impair the activity of working to be considered a disability.further,he argues that concentration and memory impairment were another limitation caused by this disability,since these were the effects of heavy doses of pain medication that would not have been necessary were it not for his underlying condition.the evidence that he could perform his job despite his impairment goes to the qualification element,jones submits,not the disability need not resolve these arguments
