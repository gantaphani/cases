facts and procedural history 
cancer diagnosis treatment at pharmablood 
in april,plaintiff wife,ramos,was diagnosed with breast cancer.she consulted a surgeon who recommended a radical mastectomy.she sought a second opinion from another surgeon in early may of,who also recommended a mastectomy.subsequently,ramos was referred to an oncologist,rizek,who examined her for the first time on may.while ramos had initially been diagnosed with a form of cancer called invasive duct carcinoma,rizek diagnosis was of inflammatory breast cancer,a type of cancer that tends to progress much faster than ramos earlier diagnosis.there was expert testimony at trial to the effect that someone diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer could die within six to twelve months without adequate treatment.rizek recommended to ramos that she begin chemotherapy on june,although ramos never began the chemotherapy treatments,anaya testified that ramos agreed to proceed with chemotherapy.according to anaya,ramos did not begin chemotherapy on the scheduled date because she was never notified that she had been approved for coverage by her insurance carrier 
according to anaya,ramos had always been interested in a natural lifestyle,and regularly visited individuals who recommended various vitamin and other natural substances to her.she continued those visits after she was diagnosed with cancer 
at some point after visiting rizek but before july,ramos and anaya became aware of lasalvia company,pharmablood,through a radio program.anaya testified that he and ramos heard a radio program that announced that lasalvia,an uruguayan doctor,had developed a new cancer vaccine that was available at the san juan bautista hospital 
a pharmablood commercial that aired in october was introduced at trial and touted pharmablood as a novel alternative to cancer patients in puerto rico.a sylvia cucci explained in the commercial that the procedure was comfortable and effective and that it was an fda approved protocol.a rubén otero was also heard in the commercial explaining that terminal patients that were told that perhaps their life expectancy was six months or less were offered the pharmablood immunotherapy and in of the population treated,it was noticed there was an increase,not only in life expectancy,but also a great improvement in the quality of life itself.
on july,anaya and ramos visited pharmablood at the san juan bautista hospital and met lasalvia as well as other pharmablood personnel.according to anaya,lasalvia examined ramos and told her that his treatment could cure her.anaya testified that after hearing this,ramos made the decision to go with the pharmablood treatment and forego other treatments.anaya also explained that pharmablood personnel told him and ramos that their medical plan would eventually cover the treatments,but that they first had to make payments up front all told,anaya and ramos paid around for the pharmablood treatments.
at pharmablood,ramos signed an informed consent form which stated that the pharmablood cancer vaccine risks were minimal inflammation or pain in the areas of the blood extraction and that it was reasonable to expect up to a percent improvement in the survival rate of forty percent in the patients who were administered the vaccine treatment.ramos began treatments with pharmablood shortly after signing the consent form.
on june,after almost one year of regular treatments with pharmablood,ramos was hospitalized at the auxilio mutuo cancer center since she was having difficulty breathing.expert testimony at trial revealed that at this point in time her cancer had progressed so far that all ramos could receive was palliative chemotherapy,to extend her life but not to attempt to cure her.the chemotherapy failed to work ramos continued to deteriorate,and eventually died on july,with her lungs full of tumors.
expert testimony at trial 
breach of the standard of care 
at trial,anaya expert,cabanillas,testified that lasalvia medical license had been revoked in hawaii.cabanillas testified that the pharmablood treatments were illegal,that they were never approved by the food and drug administration fda,and that this was not mentioned in any of the pharmablood literature he reviewed cabanillas also explained that the medical papers lasalvia had written about the pharmablood treatment were published in what were,in his professional opinion,very poor journals.cabanillas went on to criticize the studies published in these papers,stating that the design of the studies was very poor and that there were basic scientific reliability tests that were not performed.he stated i do know how the papers were published,not even in journals of low quality.i would have accepted a paper like that.
with regard to the forty percent or greater improvement mentioned in both the advertisement watched by the jury and the informed consent form signed by ramos,cabanillas testified that there was,basically,no statistical analysis of the results in lasalvia studies to be able to convince anyone that there a percent improvement.
cabanillas also testified regarding ramos medical records from the pharmablood cancer center.he testified that it appeared that lasalvia did not do a physical examination of ramos because there were no notes of such an examination in the records,something which cabanillas testified was surprising because he would have expected it of a doctor.cabanillas also testified that as part of her treatment,lasalvia gave ramos two chemotherapy drugs.however,according to cabanillas,those drugs were administered at such low doses that they could not have helped to decrease ramos cancer,and that the particular drug combination used was abandoned decades ago and fell below the standard of care.ramos was also given a third drug at pharmablood tamoxifen.according to cabanillas testimony,tamoxifen was a drug that in the past had been thought to help a patient in ramos condition.however,a medical study showed that this drug would have no effect on a patient such as ramos and should not have been used on her.cabanillas testified that the fact that ramos was given this drug fell below the standard of care.
cabanillas testified that none of the notations in the pharmablood records indicated that ramos had rejected traditional treatment.when asked if the pharmablood treatment had caused her death,cabanillas responded that ramos had lost an opportunity.explaining further,cabanillas testified that if ramos had been given a treatment that comported with the standard of care instead of the pharmablood treatment,she would have had a fifty percent chance of being alive for five years or longer instead,ramos died just over a year after beginning the pharmablood treatments.
anaya testimony on causation 
multiple times at trial,anaya was asked whether ramos had rejected traditional treatments for her cancer since she failed to start chemotherapy or get surgery as recommended by some of the doctors she saw.anaya testified unequivocally that ramos never ruled anything out she was willing to have any treatment i do believe she rejected chemotherapy,and that she did not rule out surgery.anaya testified that ramos was willing to go through chemotherapy or surgery,but that she also wanted to explore all her options.after discovering pharmablood treatment at the san juan bautista hospital and speaking with lasalvia,however,anaya testified that ramos discarded chemotherapy and surgery as options to treat her cancer anaya testified that because of its location on the first floor of the san juan bautista hospital,the literature in the waiting room describing the patents that were pending for the technology,and the representations that lasalvia made that his treatment would cure ramos cancer,he and his wife proceeded to pay over to pharmablood for their cancer vaccine.
procedural history 
after the conclusion of plaintiff presentation of evidence,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law,alleging that there was nothing that lasalvia did to cause ramos death because she had refused standard medical treatment.the district court denied the motion and defendants rested their case without putting on any evidence.the case was submitted to the jury which found for plaintiff and awarded him in damages.
subsequently,defendants renewed their motion for judgment as a matter of law,and this time the district court granted it,overturning the jury verdict and concluding as a matter of law that lasalvia quackery was not the cause of juana ramos demise and that instead her own election of medical remedies and the devastating nature of the disease caused her death.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law.gloria,cir.we will not approve of a district court ruling setting aside the jury verdict unless the evidence was so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the verdict that no reasonable jury could have returned it.hannaford,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
under puerto rico law,to establish a prima facie case for medical malpractice the plaintiff must show that defendant owed plaintiff a duty defendant breached that duty and there was a sufficient causal nexus between the breach and some resultant harm.quality health servs.of puerto rico,cir.
the adequate causation doctrine governs in puerto rico to determine legal causation between the negligent act or omission and the harm.according to this doctrine,not any condition without which a result would not have occurred is a cause,but that which would ordinarily produce it according to experience.pursuant to this doctrine,the issue to be addressed is whether the materialization of the harm was to be expected in the normal course of events or if,on the contrary,it can not be calculated.

on appeal,defendants do not contest that lasalvia owed a duty of care to ramos.lasalvia was an oncologist practicing in rented space at the san juan bautista hospital.ramos went to see him to care for her cancer and he represented to her that she would receive an treatment that improved the survival of forty percent of patients who took it.even more,according to uncontroverted testimony at trial,lasalvia himself told ramos and anaya that his treatment could cure her of cancer.
there is also no question that a reasonable jury could have found that lasalvia breached his duty in numerous ways.there was uncontroverted expert testimony that lasalvia treatment was not,despite advertisements claiming otherwise,and that the kind and quantity of drugs given to ramos violated the standard of care.there was also uncontroverted expert testimony that the medical papers lasalvia published on the pharmablood treatment were published in journals and lacked basic scientific research methodology.the jury also heard plaintiff testimony that lasalvia promised plaintiff and ramos that his treatment would cure her.
finally,the informed consent form could be considered a breach of duty in and of itself.according to unrebutted expert testimony,the form that ramos signed only explained that the risks involved minimal inflammation or pain in the site of the blood extraction.in the benefits and probabilities of success section,the form stated that it was reasonable to expect an improvement in the survival rate of forty percent of the patients who receive the pharmablood treatment and also said that the prolongation of life could be more than percent of the average person plaintiff expert testified that these improvement figures had no basis whatsoever in addition,plaintiff expert testified that contrary to standard practice in the oncology field,the informed consent form did not reflect the approval of any institution.see,sepúlveda de arrieta,wl applied to the present case,the issue to be addressed is whether in the normal course of events the defendant doctor had to foresee that the lack of pertinent information would lead the patient to take a different decision than the one she would have taken if she had been suitably informed.cruz avilés bella vista,d,finding that under puerto rico law a patient suing for lack of informed consent does not need to prove a separate negligent act,other than the lack of informed consent.
defendants urge us to affirm the district court reversal of the jury verdict because,based on the evidence presented,a reasonable jury could not have concluded that plaintiff met his burden to show that defendants sufficiently caused plaintiff harm under puerto rico law.we disagree.
we begin at the beginning,making clear that the harm complained of in this case was,as plaintiff expert testified,the opportunity that ramos lost because defendants induced her to choose the pharmablood treatment instead of traditional methods.in order to be found liable,that lost opportunity harm needed to have been sufficiently foreseeable to defendants.we find that there was sufficient evidence of a causal nexus between defendants multiple breaches of duty and ramos untimely death.
anaya testified at trial that ramos only decided to forego chemotherapy and surgery after meeting lasalvia.anaya expert,cabanillas,testified that there was no indication in the pharmablood records that ramos had ruled out chemotherapy or surgery defendants point to evidence that allegedly contradicted that testimony.they point to the fact that ramos went to three different doctors after her cancer diagnosis and did not show up for chemotherapy after an appointment had been scheduled.they also point to a notation in a medical record which stated that ramos had rejected chemotherapy and other traditional treatments.the physician who wrote those notes saw ramos over a year after she began seeing lasalvia and receiving the pharmablood treatments.the notation was made by the physician who saw ramos after she sought treatment for difficulty breathing.
defendants are correct that there was evidence on the record that ramos was determined not to submit herself to chemotherapy or surgery for her cancer.however,there was also evidence to the contrary.specifically,the jury heard anaya testimony that ramos had never ruled anything out until she met with lasalvia,and that the reason she missed the chemotherapy appointment was because no one notified her that her insurance was going to cover it.that testimony was fact that the insurance company paid for all other treatments does not undermine anaya the jury was entitled to believe anaya and his expert over the other evidence.
defendants also point to the signed informed consent form as evidence that ramos knowingly rejected all forms of traditional medical treatment.the form stated that the pharmablood treatments were meant to be undertaken by patients for whom chemotherapy surgery had failed,was not possible,or had been rejected.but,anaya testified that lasalvia told him and ramos that his treatment would cure ramos and that she rejected other possible treatments based on his representations.defendants also point to the payment form,which stated that pharmablood treatments were not covered by health insurance,arguing that this should have clued in ramos and anaya to the fact that this was an experimental treatment.however,plaintiff expert testified that he did not see anything in pharmablood literature that explained that this was an experimental treatment indeed,the evidence presented showed that defendants were advertising the treatment as,and
