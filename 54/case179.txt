justice holmes once observed that foreign legal systems can appear to the uninitiated like a wall of stone,impenetrable and unyielding.diaz gonzalez.holmes.for over a century,the federal courts attempted to scale this stone wall by treating questions of foreign law as questions of fact to be pleaded and proved.but over the years,this method proved unsatisfactory,obscuring rather than illuminating the content and nuance of foreign laws.finally,in,following a proliferation of international litigation,federal rule of civil procedure was adopted to furnish federal courts with a uniform procedure for raising and determining an issue concerning foreign law.fed.civ.advisory committee note.now,according to the rule,a court determination of foreign law must be treated as a ruling on a question of law.fed.civ.
despite the clear mandate of the federal rule,this appeal illustrates the difficulty that can arise in determining foreign law and the confusion surrounding the role of foreign law in domestic proceedings.the dispute stems from the transcontinental attempts of yves sicre de fontbrune to protect his copyright in photographs of pablo picasso artworks after an american art editor,alan wofsy and alan wofsy and associates collectively,wofsy,reproduced the photographic images.as part of his efforts,de fontbrune received a judgment in french court of two million euros in astreinte against wofsy for copyright violations.de fontbrune sought to enforce this astreinte in federal court in california under the california uniform foreign court monetary judgment recognition act uniform recognition act or the act,cal.civ.proc.code et.
the picasso photographs intended to convey the quintessence of picasso artworks now require us to delve into the essence of astreinte,a french judicial device.the enforceability of the french award turns on whether,in this case,the astreinte functions as a fine or penalty which the uniform recognition act does not recognize or as a grant of monetary recovery which is statutorily cognizable.the answer to this question is not a simple matter of translation,but,as we explain,requires a broader look at french law to understand the nature of the astreinte remedy in this case,in conjunction with an analysis of california law regarding the enforcement of foreign judgments.
in granting wofsy rule b motion to dismiss de fontbrune claim,the district court considered the parties expert declarations on the nature of astreinte.we disagree with de fontbrune proposition that consideration of such materials outside the pleadings was error.rather,under rule broad mandate,foreign legal materials including expert declarations on foreign law can be considered in ruling on a motion to dismiss where foreign law provides the basis for the claim.we reverse and remand,however,because,the district court erred in concluding that the astreinte awarded by the french court in this case functioned as a fine or other penalty for purposes of the uniform recognition act.
background 
between and,christian zervos took almost photographs of picasso art.these pictures were ultimately published by cahiers in what has become a universally recognized reference work the zervos catalog a volume catalogue raisonné of picasso artistic corpus.de fontbrune purchased cahiers publisher stock in,thereby acquiring intellectual property rights in the zervos catalog under french law.
almost two decades later,wofsy reproduced several photographs from the zervos catalog in two volumes on picasso,which he offered for sale at a parisian book fair.de fontbrune brought suit in french court claiming that these reproductions violated his copyright in the zervos catalog.
after a french trial court rejected his claims,de fontbrune appealed to the paris court of appeal.in a decision the judgment,the court of appeal concluded that wofsy was guilty of infringement of copyright and ha d infringed on de fontbrune rights.the court accordingly prohibited wofsy from the use in any manner whatsoever of the zervos photographs under penalty of astreinte of francs by proven infraction,and required wofsy to pay de fontbrune francs in pecuniary damages in redress of his injury resulting from the infringement of copyright.
ten years later,de fontbrune filed a claim with an enforcement judge at the tribunal de grande instance de paris high court of paris for liquidation made against wofsy by judgment of the paris court of appeal.de fontbrune sought a judgment ordering wofsy to pay him the sum of euros from the amount of the liquidation.
in a decision the judgment,the enforcement judge found that wofsy had violated the judgment by reproducing copyrighted images from the zervos catalog.the judge accordingly a ward ed the astreinte prounounced by the paris court of appeal in the amount of euros,as well as euros in costs.
de fontbrune then initiated proceedings in california state court seeking recognition of the judgment under the uniform recognition act.wofsy removed the action to federal court on diversity grounds,and filed a motion to dismiss under rule b.
wofsy motion contested the characterization of astreinte as damages in the english versions of the and judgments attached to de fontbrune complaint.wofsy argued that astreinte functions as a penalty not as an award of damages and is thus not cognizable under the uniform recognition act.in support of this assertion,wofsy supplied a declaration by a french lawyer,vonnick le guillou.de fontbrune countered with a declaration from his own expert on french law,christopher mesnooh,explaining that,in the french system,astreinte can function as an award of damages.de fontbrune also argued that the district court should strike guillou declaration as evidence outside the pleadings impermissibly filed in support of a motion to dismiss.
faced with conflicting information about the function of astreinte in french law,the district court initially denied wofsy motion in part,concluding that determining whether astreinte is a fine,a penalty,damages,or something else require d an analysis of french law that would be premature at the pleadings stage.the district court also declined to consider guillou declaration under rule,on the grounds that the rule did not expressly allow the court to consider evidence outside the pleadings on a rule b motion,and that a party relying on foreign law bears the burden of proving the content of that law.
after wofsy filed a motion for reconsideration,together with a reply declaration from guillou,the district court reversed course.this time around,the district court concluded that its previous finding concerning judicial notice of foreign law was in error and vacated the order denying wofsy motion to dismiss.in a complete volte face,the district court reasoned that rule permits judicial consideration of any relevant material or source in determining foreign law,irrespective of its admissibility as evidence.because determinations of foreign law are issues of law,not fact,the court also concluded that it could take judicial notice of the declarations of the french legal experts,insofar as they relate to french law.
taking these declarations into consideration,the court determined that the primary purpose of the astreinte was not to compensate de fontbrune for the damages he suffered,but to compel wofsy compliance with the judgment.the court concluded that the astreinte thus functioned as a penalty and so was not cognizable under the uniform recognition act.de fontbrune now appeals from the district court dismissal of the action with prejudice 
the district court vacillation illustrates the lingering uncertainty surrounding the role of foreign law in domestic proceedings,even after the advent of rule.we take this opportunity to address a question that no circuit has yet answered directly,perhaps because the answer is implicit in the rule whether rule authorizes district courts to consider foreign legal materials outside the pleadings in ruling on a motion to dismiss.our answer is yes,because rule treats foreign law determinations as questions of law,not fact.
foreign law under rule 
rule provides 
a party who intends to raise an issue about a foreign country law must give notice by a pleading or other writing.in determining foreign law,the court may consider any relevant material or source,including testimony,whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under the federal rules of evidence.the court determination must be treated as a ruling on a question of law.
the adoption of rule in marked a sea change in the treatment of foreign law by the federal courts.see twohy first bank of,cir.prior to its adoption,foreign law was viewed as a question of fact to be proved like other facts.church hubbart,cranch.marshall.the treatment of foreign law as fact reflected understandable judicial discomfort with questions of foreign law due to inevitable unfamiliarity with the substance and nuance of the legal systems of other countries.arthur miller,federal rule and the fact approach to determining foreign law death knell for a die hard doctrine.
rule endeavored to lay to rest this antiquated conception of foreign law as a question of fact that must be proved at trial and reviewed on appeal only for clear error.rationis enters.of pan.hyundai mipo dockyard,cir.the rule achieved this transformation by making the process of ascertaining foreign law equivalent to the process for determining domestic law,insofar as possible.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.see also matter of mclinn,cir.analogizing treatment of foreign law and treatment of laws of sister states.
rule thus unshackles courts and litigants from the evidentiary and procedural requirements that apply to factual determinations.it accordingly permits courts to consider any relevant material,including testimony,without regard to its admissibility under rule,authorizes the court to engage in its own research,eschews any requirement that the court formally take judicial notice of foreign law,and obviates the need for the court to provide formal notice to the parties of its intention to engage in its own research on an issue of foreign law which has been raised by them,or of its intention to raise and determine independently an issue not raised by them.fed.civ.advisory committee note.
the rule requirements are intended to be flexible and informal to encourage the court and counsel to regard the determination of foreign law as a cooperative venture requiring an open and unstructured dialogue among all concerned.wright miller at.rule exhorts trial and appellate courts alike to make the most of this flexibility to independently research and analyze foreign law particularly as such issues will undoubtedly continue coming to the federal courts with increasing frequency as the global economy expands and transactions increase.curley amr,cir.see also twohy,at in determining questions of foreign law,both trial and appellate courts are urged to research and analyze foreign law independently.
we have likewise stressed the district court independent obligation to adequately ascertain relevant foreign law,even if the parties submissions are lacking.see universe sales,silver castle,cir.noting it is not novel for an appellate court to determine that a district court performed an inadequate inquiry into foreign law citing twohy,at.independent research,plus the testimony of foreign legal experts,together with extracts of foreign legal materials,has been and will likely continue to be the basic mode of determining foreign law.id.at.importantly,such material and testimony may be considered at any time,whether or not submitted by a party.stuart united states,cir,rev on other grounds by united states stuart,d cf kaho ilchert,cir.noting that the traditional prohibition against considering materials not before an agency does not apply to consideration of foreign legal materials under rule.
yet despite rule seemingly clear language,federal courts have largely remained hesitant to engage with questions of foreign law as fully and independently as they do with questions of domestic law confusion and contradiction continue to plague the application of rule.see,peter hay,the use and determination of foreign law in civil litigation in the united states,am.comp.supp,noting the lack of uniformity in application of rule.
the application of rule has also been beset by semantic sloppiness.courts continue to refer to the burden of proving foreign law.see,mcgee arkel int l,llc,cir.referencing the plaintiff burden of proving foreign law and requiring that litigants present to the district court clear proof of the relevant legal principles internal quotations and citations omitted ferrostaal,sea phoenix,cir.explaining that,because rule does not impose a duty on courts to conduct independent research into foreign law,the parties carry the burden of proving it.imposing a burden of proof on the parties is at odds with the mandate of rule.to be sure,under rule,a party raising a foreign law issue must give notice by pleading on other writings.but this notice is not tantamount to a burden of proof.
in light of the lingering conflicts in the application of rule and in the absence of any guiding precedent from the higher courts it is unsurprising that uncertainty surrounds the precise issue of whether it is appropriate for a district court to consider foreign legal materials outside of the pleadings in ruling on a motion to dismiss.district courts addressing this question have predictably adopted differing approaches.compare abdallah int l lease fin,cal.acknowledging practical considerations that often require reliance on evidence concerning substance of foreign law at rule b stage,with united states pounds of salmon,more or less,treating a motion to dismiss in accordance with fed.civ.b as one for summary judgment,and explaining reluctance to rule on foreign legal questions without a more complete picture of the foreign legal and regulatory system.
since matters outside the pleadings are often required to determine foreign law,summary judgment may appear at first blush to be the appropriate mechanism for dismissing a claim when foreign law applies.grice ludwig mowinckels.the continued misplaced emphasis on the parties burden of proving foreign law,the frequently intertwined factual questions,and the sheer complexity of ascertaining foreign law all might superficially support this conclusion.but it would be antithetical to the language and purpose of rule to prohibit courts from considering relevant materials beyond the pleadings in ruling on a rule b motion when the claim depends on a determination of foreign law.this does not preclude the possibility that there may be situations where factual matters underlie the legal determination and that,in such a case,summary judgment may be the appropriate procedural mechanism for resolution.
the general prohibition against looking at matters beyond the complaint to resolve a rule b motion ensures that parties have adequate notice to present additional evidence and establish whether there are any genuine issues of material fact to be resolved.see,cortec,sum holding,cir.noting that the rule requiring the conversion of a rule b motion to a motion for summary judgment when materials outside the pleadings are considered ensures that the party against whom the motion to dismiss is made may respond with evidence of its own.these concerns are not implicated by the consideration of foreign legal materials at the pleading stage.under rule,rulings on foreign law are determinations of law,not of fact.accordingly,even differences of opinion on the content,applicability,or interpretation of a foreign provision may not be characterized as a genuine issue as to any material fact banco de credito,tesoreria general,cir.quoting john brown,ways to prove foreign law.
the rule authorizes courts to conduct independent research outside the parties submissions in determining foreign law.its deliberately flexible procedures for presenting and utilizing material on issues of foreign law,fed.civ.advisory committee note,likewise cut against a determination that district courts should be prohibited from considering relevant foreign legal materials at the motion to dismiss stage.
importantly,because foreign law interpretation and determination is a question of law,independent judicial research does not implicate the judicial notice and ex parte issues spawned by independent factual research undertaken by a court.see edmund morgan,judicial notice,harv,explaining that,while the judge is unrestricted in his investigation and conclusion in determining the content of legal rules,t he situation as to disputed and disputable issues of fact is different,and the judge is not permitted to make an independent investigation see also rowe gibson,cir.hamilton,dissenting noting that looking at facts outside the record turns the court from a neutral into an advocate for one side blunt united states,cir.warning that adding to the record t akes on the aspect of advocacy.
judicial research into domestic law provides an appropriate analog.although our common law system relies heavily on advocacy by the parties,judges are free to undertake independent legal research beyond the parties submissions.it is no revelation that courts look to cases,statutes,regulations,treatises,scholarly articles,legislative history,treaties and other legal materials in figuring out what the law is and resolving legal issues.independent judicial research into the content of foreign law thus leaves undisturbed a bedrock principle of our adversarial system that adversarial testing is the surest route to truth,and the failure to expose facts to such rigorous testing can undermine the quality of factual findings.brianne gorod,the adversarial myth appellate court extra record factfinding,duke.rather,determining foreign law like determining domestic law requires adequate study,without which there can be neither the adequate reflection nor that fruitful interchange of minds which is indispensable to thoughtful,unhurried decision and its formulation in learned and impressive opinions.salve regina coll.russell,d quoting dick life ins,d frankfurter,dissenting.
two of our sister circuits appear to have tacitly endorsed this interpretation of rule,without explicitly addressing the question before us.in baloco ex rel.tapia drummond,the eleventh circuit considered an expert affidavit on colombian law that had been submitted to the district court as part of a response to a motion to dismiss under rule,cir.similarly,in twohy,in considering an appeal arising out of a rule c motion for a claim arising under spanish law,the seventh circuit chided the district court for considering only a series of affidavits of foreign law experts concerning issues of spanish law relevant to the case,and not fully me eting its duty to ascertain foreign law under rule.at.
thus,we hold that courts do not transgress the broad boundaries established by rule when considering foreign legal materials including expert testimony and declarations at the pleading stage,and the district court here did not err in considering expert declarations on the content of french law in ruling on wofsy rule b motion.
ii.california uniform recognition act 
the district court erred in concluding that the award of an astreinte in this case constitutes a penalty for purposes of the uniform recognition act.to explain why this is so,we first review the requirements governing the recognition of foreign court monetary judgments under california law and then consider the nature of the astreinte in the judgment at issue.see richmark timber falling consultants,cir.all questions of law,including questions of foreign law,are reviewed de novo.
california uniform recognition act governs the enforcement of judgments that grant or deny monetary recovery and are final,conclusive,and enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction where rendered.cal.civ.proc.code a.a judgment that constitutes a fine or other penalty,however,is not cognizable under the statute.id.b.the statutory exclusion of fines or penalties reflects an ancient maxim of international law that t he courts of no country execute the penal laws of another.the antelope,wheat.marshall,hyundai sec.lee,th,d.
the prescription against recognizing or enforcing penal laws focuses on whether the character of the foreign judgment is essentially punitive or compensatory.see,restatement second of conflicts of laws cmt.a explaining that the narrow prohibition applies only to actions brought for the purpose of punishing the defendant for a wrong done by him and does not apply to actions brought by a private person to recover compensation for a loss restatement third of foreign relations law cmt.b a penal judgment is primarily punitive rather than compensatory in character.the prohibition reflect s a reluctance of courts to subject foreign public law to judicial scrutiny combined with reluctance to enforce law that may conflict with the public policy of the forum state and distrust of foreign criminal procedures.restatement third of foreign relations law.
adopting the test articulated by the supreme court in huntington attrill,the california courts likewise concentrate on the character of a foreign judgment.java oil sullivan,th,d.in huntington,the supreme court explained that determining whether a foreign law is a penal law,in the international sense,so that it can not be enforced in the courts of another state,depends upon whether its purpose is to punish an offense against the public justice of the state,or to afford a private remedy to a person injured by the wrongful act.at.this inquiry entails consideration of whether the harm the foreign judgment seeks to redress is private or public.private harms are an infringement or privation of the private or civil rights belonging to individuals,considered as individuals,whereas public harms are a breach and violation of public rights and duties,which affect the whole community,considered as a community.id.at.quoting william blackstone,commentaries.
the court acknowledged the elasticity of the terms penal and penalty in both the british and american systems,noting that,while these terms s trictly and primarily denote punishment imposed and enforced by the state for a crime or offense against its laws,they also commonly encompass any extraordinary liability to which the law subjects a wrongdoer in favor of the person wronged.id.at.the court emphasized that,for purposes of recognition and enforcement,p enal laws,strictly and properly,are those imposing punishment for an offense committed against the state,and which the executive of the state has the power to pardon.id.at.in contrast,s tatutes giving a private cause of action against the wrongdoer are sometimes spoken of as penal in their nature,but neither the liability imposed nor the remedy given is strictly penal.id.
the court cautioned against being misled by nomenclature,emphasizing that the crux of the analysis is not whether a judgment is termed penal or a penalty by the courts of the country in which it was passed,but whether it appears,to the tribunal which is called upon to enforce it,to be,in its essential character and effect,a punishment of an offense against the public,or a grant of a civil right to a private person.id.at.this admonition recognizes that translation will always be incomplete,because the resonances from centuries of legal,political,and literary use that necessarily accompany any legal term can never be fully transferred by translation alone.john joseph,indeterminacy,translation and the law,in translation and the law,marshall morris.
in undertaking the huntington inquiry,california uses a nuanced balancing test to determine whether the essential character and effect of an award is penal an approach that acknowledges that courts must consider more than how a term is translated to understand the nature of a foreign judgment.the java oil test thus looks to a number of factors,including whether the purpose of the award is to compensate an individual or to provide an example or punish an offense against the public whether the award is payable to an individual or to the state or one of its organs whether the judgment arose in the context of a civil action or through the enforcement of penal laws and whether the award was a mandatory fine,sanction,or multiplier.java oil,d at see also hyundai,d at relying on java oil factors in determining whether a foreign judgment was a penalty.
no one factor is determinative,and,not surprisingly,the same factors may point in differing directions.in hyundai,for example,hyundai securities sought enforcement of a korean judgment that included indemnification for a criminal fine the company had paid on behalf of ik chi lee,its former ceo.d at.lee argued that,because the indemnification order was based on a criminal fine,it was penal in nature and not cognizable under the act.id.at.the california court of appeal disagreed,reasoning that the purpose of the korean judgment was to compensate hyundai for the damages it suffered from having to pay a fine,and that the prohibition against the recognition of a judgment based on a fine does not include an award to compensate a plaintiff.id.at.
iii.the nature of the astreinte in the french judgment against wofsy 
with the java oil factors in mind,we turn to the nature of the astreinte in the french legal system generally and more particularly in the judgment against wofsy.heeding our own advice,we consider the judgment itself,the expert declarations and materials on the astreinte submitted to the district court by de fontbrune and wofsy,as well as our own research into american and french law.
at the outset,we note that the astreinte is a device that may appear rather strange to common law lawyers.an introduction to french law george bermann etienne picard.it currently occupies a role of considerable procedural and substantive complexity.mitchell,imperium by the back door the astreinte and the enforcement of contractual obligations in france,toronto fac.unsurprisingly,then,the astreinte can not be neatly categorized as either essentially penal or wholly civil in nature.it is hybrid,with elements that cut both ways.
to begin,we emphasize that we can not ascertain whether the astreinte is a fine or other penalty simply by turning to translations or dictionary definitions.citing the dictionnaire juridique français anglais and the council of europe legal dictionary,wofsy counsel argued that astreinte means a fine for noncompliance with a judgment.but the test is not whether astreinte is translated as fine or penalty.rather,we must look to whether it appears,to the tribunal which is called upon to enforce it,to be,in its essential character and effect,a punishment of an offense against the public,or a grant of a civil right to a private person.huntington,at.dictionaries may be a starting point,but in this case are of limited utility in looking beneath the surface to determine the essential character and effect of the foreign judgment.indeed,the limitations of terminology for understanding the character and purpose of a foreign award is reflected in the nuanced nature of the java oil test.although the uniform recognition act prohibits recognition of a fine or other penalty,the java oil factors do not rely on this vocabulary to determine what judgments fall within the act exception to enforcement.we must accordingly be cautious about falling back on bald nomenclature as providing a definitive category in lieu of undertaking the analysis of foreign judgments required by java oil.
the declarations of the parties experts illustrate the variegated character of the astreinte.the statements of the experts and argument by counsel conjure up an image of one side pointing a finger one way,and the other side pointing a finger in the opposite direction.on the one hand,the guillou declarations take the position that the astreinte is awarded independent of damages,calculated based on the behavior of the defendant rather than injury to the plaintiff.its purpose is thus not,strictly speaking,to compensate for actual pecuniary harm.rather,it operates as a sort of private penalty,intended to deter and punish noncompliance with the court judgment.although guillou describes the astreinte as a means to vindicate the public interest in compliance with court orders,she does not suggest that the order was intended to punish an offense against the public.thus,guillou characterizes the astreinte as a private penalty that is a personal legal measure of constraint.but of course,invoking the word penalty without benchmarking it against the java oil analysis does not answer the question.
on the other hand,the mesnooh declaration states that the astreinte is imposed by a judge,always for an amount of money,ordering a party which is subject to a court order to do something to comply with such order.an astreinte can thus be awarded only in connection with a valid and enforceable legal duty.according to mesnooh,the astreinte is a personal remedy,payable entirely to the party seeking enforcement of an astreinte,not to the court or any other part of the french state.the amount is within the discretion of the judge,and can be modified before it is reduced to judgment.although not a grant of a civil right to a private person,the astreinte is not a punishment for a crime against the public,either.it is awarded,rather,for the sole benefit of the party seeking the remedy.
the experts recitations,which sometimes overlap,are useful in laying out some of the characteristics of the astreinte.however,with the exception of parts of the mesnooh declaration,they do not provide the answer to our state law inquiry.additional explanatory materials indicate that french judges devised the astreinte as a coercive sanction which operates in its own right to secure enforcement of a judgment.michael chesterman,contempt in the common law but not the civil law,int l comp.the astreinte is now widely used in the french legal system to obtain the performance of any type of obligation for matters civil or commercial,and also in administrative matters including those in which the party owing performance is the state or a public body.james gordley arthur von mehren,an introduction to the comparative study of private law.in this regard,as guillou noted,astreinte can be seen as analogous to contempt of court the protean nature and wide applicability of astreinte warns against a blanket determination that the device is always either punitive or compensatory.rather,we must consider a particular astreinte in the context in which it was awarded.
turning to the first java oil factor,the context of the french orders here persuades us that the purpose of the astreinte awarded to de fontbrune was not to punish an offense against the public or make an example of wofsy,see d at,but to safeguard de fontbrune copyright.the judgment prohibited wofsy from using the zervos photographs under penalty of astreinte of francs per violation.the court concluded that wofsy had infringed de fontbrune copyright in the zervos catalog in violation of articles and of the french intellectual property code.according to these articles any reproduction by any means of a work of the mind,any edition of writings,musical compositions,drawings,paintings,or any other printed or engraved production made in violation of rules protecting the authors right is an infringement any infringement is an offence.nicolas bouche,intellectual property law in france ed.such infringements may entail criminal and civil sanctions as remedies.id.at.the criminal sanctions include a term of three years imprisonment and a fine of eur.id.at.we note that the word translated here as fine is amende not astreinte in the original french version.code de la propriété intellectuelle intellectual property code art.the civil remedies include both damages and an order requiring cessation of the infringing acts.bouche,supra,at.such an order enjoining the infringing acts may be made,if necessary,under astreinte.code de la propriété intellectuelle intellectual property code art.
in the judgment,the paris court of appeal awarded both forms of civil remedies that is,pecuniary damages for de fontbrune injury and an injunction against future reproductions of the zervos catalog images under an astreinte.the court did not,however,impose any of the criminal sanctions provided for in the intellectual property code.thus,the astreinte was not awarded pursuant to the court authority to criminally punish copyright violations under the intellectual property code through imposing an amende.
the astreinte was awarded separately and apart from the pecuniary damages awarded by both the paris court of appeal and the enforcement judge.the enforcement judge expressly referenced articles and of the law of july pursuant to which any french judge could order liquidation,taking into consideration the behaviour of the party to whom the injunction has been addressed,and the difficulties that he or she has encountered in executing it.
ultimately,the purpose of the astreinte was to set a sum,per violation,for wofsy failure to comply with the judicial prohibition on the continued use of de fontbrune copyrighted photographs.in this sense,it may be likened to a civil contempt order.the california supreme court has clarified that the primary object of civil contempt is to protect the rights of litigants civil contempt is a remedy imposed to coerce compliance with a lawful order of the court.in re nolan,cal th,d,internal quotations and citations omitted.civil contempt orders are thus remedial,and for the benefit of the plaintiff.bagwell,at.quoting gompers bucks stove range.here,as guillou pointed out,the astreinte was a personal legal measure of constraint,for de fontbrune benefit in other words a remedy imposed to coerce compliance with the paris court of appeal lawful order to stop wofsy using de fontbrune copyrighted images.
cast in another light,the astreinte here may also be seen as fulfilling a function akin to statutory damages in american copyright law,although we acknowledge that de fontbrune was awarded damages separately.in the system,a party may opt for an award of statutory damages rather than actual damages.c.such damages are intended to induce copyright holders to enforce their copyrights and to deter infringers by preventing unjust enrichment,even where actual damages are unproved.roger blair thomas cotter,an economic analysis of damages rules in intellectual property law,mary.here,too,the astreinte was awarded without determining the actual amount of pecuniary harm suffered by de fontbrune as a result of wofsy continued use of the zervos catalog images.nevertheless,the purpose of the award was not to punish a harm against the public,but to vindicate de fontbrune personal interest in having his copyright respected and to deter further future infringements by wofsy.
the remaining java oil factors weigh in favor of our conclusion that the astreinte was not essentially penal in nature.significantly,the astreinte awarded was payable directly to de fontbrune,rather than to a court or the french state.as the mesnooh declaration noted,an astreinte creates a debt belonging to the party which is condemned to pay the astreinte.the result is that the beneficiaries of the underlying award for damages becomes a creditor for the amount of the astreinte.see francois chabas,régime de la réparation jurisclasseur civil code article.
turning to the nature of the proceedings,the astreinte here was awarded in the context of a civil action in order to enforce a civil remedy provided for in the french intellectual property code.no criminal or penal proceedings were involved.and,finally,the award was not a mandatory fine,sanction or multiplier.indeed,an astreinte effectiveness is a function of the choice of the amount which is freely determined by the judge.gordley von mehren,supra,at.in fact,the enforcement judge accepted a reduction of the astreinte to euro,which is consistent with the notion that she retained final discretion to determine the amount.in all,the astreinte was not essentially a punishment of an offense against the public rather,it afford ed a private remedy to de fontbrune,a person injured by the wrongful act.see huntington,at.
our conclusion is buttressed by contrasting the nature of the astreinte awarded here with another case in which our court considered in dicta the character of an astreinte imposed under french criminal law and in a different context.the case of la ligue contre le racisme et arose from the availability in france of memorabilia on auction site,cir.en banc per curiam.a french court issued an injunction ordering to remove access to the memorabilia or pay euros per day of delay.id.at.claimed that the threat of a monetary penalty h ung over it like the sword of damocles.id.at.we stated that even if the french court were to impose a monetary penalty against,it is exceedingly unlikely that it would be an enforceable penalty under the uniform recognition act.id.at.
four factors suggested that the astreinte at issue in was penal rather than compensatory in character.first,the word astreinte was consistently translated as penalty.id.at.second,the sanctions were imposed for violations of the french penal code,which declares it a crime to exhibit or display nazi emblems,and which prescribes a set of criminal penalties,including fines.id.in other words,the penalty in was imposed for a breach and violation of public rights and duties,which affect the whole community,considered as a community.huntington,at.quoting william blackstone,commentaries.third,the penalties imposed by the french court were expressly intended to deter from creating a threat to internal public order obviously,an issue of public interest affecting the whole community,not solely related to a private dispute,at.as we noted,such judgments designed to deter conduct that constitutes a threat to the public order are typically penal in nature.id.finally,the astreinte was payable to the government and not a private individual or group further underscoring the public nature of award.id.here,in contrast,the astreinte was imposed in the context of a civil action for contravening an injunction against the use of copyrighted materials and was payable to the individual copyright holder.
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that the astreinte awarded by the french courts to de fontbrune falls within the uniform recognition act as a judgment that g rants a sum of money.cal.civ.proc.code a.in this case,the astreinte was not a fine or other penalty for purposes of the act,id.b,and accordingly the district court erred in concluding otherwise.

while his appeal was pending,de fontbrune died.his wife and children filed a motion for substitution of party to continue these proceedings as de fontbrune successors in interest pursuant to california civil procedure code.we grant this motion.for convenience,we refer to the appellants collectively as de fontbrune.
the functional similarity between the astreinte and contempt of court of course does not answer whether the astreinte here is designed to punish an offense against the public,or is in the nature of a grant of a civil right to a private party.contempt may be civil or penal,and even within our own system,parsing coercive civil and criminal contempt orders is no easy matter.int l union,united mine workers of am,d.superficial comparisons between judicial devices in divergent legal systems can not answer that question.
we note that the law of july was modified in and abrogated in.see loi du juillet,journal officiel de la république française,july,ordonnance du décembre,journal officiel de la république française.
while the french characterization of the astreinte is not determinative of whether the astreinte is penal or remedial under law,we note that our conclusion is reinforced by a decision of the french high court noting the civil nature of the device.the french case centered on the enforceability of a million penalty imposed on an american citizen and french resident,richard blech,for his role in a ponzi scheme.the scheme resulted in an estimated million in damages to the victims.credit bancorp,civ rws,wl.a court ordered blech to cooperate with the receiver appointed to trace blech assets unde
